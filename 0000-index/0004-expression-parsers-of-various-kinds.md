### Expression Parsers of various kinds

- **cel-cpp** [📁](./cel-cpp) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/cel-cpp) -- C++ Implementations of the Common Expression Language. For background on the Common Expression Language see the cel-spec repo. Common Expression Language specification: the Common Expression Language (CEL) implements common semantics for expression evaluation, enabling different applications to more easily interoperate. Key Applications are (1) Security policy: organizations have complex infrastructure and need common tooling to reason about the system as a whole and (2) Protocols: expressions are a useful data type and require interoperability across programming languages and platforms.

- **exprtk** [📁](./exprtk) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/exprtk) -- C++ Mathematical Expression Toolkit Library is a simple to use, easy to integrate and extremely efficient run-time mathematical expression parsing and evaluation engine. The parsing engine supports numerous forms of functional and logic processing semantics and is easily extensible.
- **tinyexpr** [📁](./tinyexpr) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/tinyexpr) -- a very small recursive descent parser and evaluation engine for math expressions.
