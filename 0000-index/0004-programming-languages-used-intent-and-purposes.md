## Programming Languages used: *intent and purposes*

We expect to use these languages in processes which require this type of IPC:

- C / C++ (**backend No.1**)
  + PDF renderer ([mupdf](https://mupdf.com/))
  + metadata & annotations extractor ([mupdf](https://mupdf.com/) et al)
  + *very* probably also the database interface (SQLite)
  + \[page] image processing (leptonica, openCV, ImageMagick?, what-ever turns out to be useful and reasonable to integrate (particularly between PDF page renderer and OCR engine to help us provide a *user-tunable* PDF text+metadata extractor
  + OCR (tesseract)
  + "A.I."-assisted tooling to help process and *clean* PDFs: cover pages, abstract/summary extraction for meta-research, etc. (think ngrams, xdelta, SVM, tensors, author identification, document categorization, document similarity / \[*near*-]duplicate / revision detection, tagging, ...)
  + document identifier key generator a.k.a. **content hasher** for creating **unique** key for each document, which can be used as database record index, etc.
    * old: Qiqqa SHA1B
    * new: BLAKE3+Base36

- C# (**"business logic" / "middleware"**: the glue logic)
- Java (SOLR / Lucene: our choice for the "full text search database" ~ **backend No.2**)
- JavaScript (**UI**, mostly. Think [*electron*](https://www.electronjs.org/), *web browser*, [*Chromely*](https://chromely.net/)<sup>[also](https://github.com/chromelyapps/Chromely)</sup>, [*WebView2*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/)<sup>[plus](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/)</sup>, that sort of thing)

Here we *intend* to use the regular SOLR APIs, which does not require specialized binary IPC.

We **may** **probably** choose to use a web-centric UI approach where images are *compressed* and *cached* in the *backend*, while being provided as \<picture> or \<img> tag references (URLs) in the HTML generated by the backend. *However*, we keep our options open ATM as furtheer testing is expected to hit a few obstacles there (smart caching required as we will be processing lots of documents in "background **bulk processes**" alongside the browsing and other more *direct* user activity) so a *websocket* or similar push technology may be employed: there we may benefit from dedicated IPC for large binary and text data transfers.
