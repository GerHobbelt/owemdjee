### INI

- **inih** [📁](./inih) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/inih) -- **inih (INI Not Invented Here)** is a simple [.INI file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file) parser written in C. It's only a couple of pages of code, and it was designed to be _small and simple_, so it's good for embedded systems. It's also more or less compatible with Python's [ConfigParser](http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html) style of .INI files, including RFC 822-style multi-line syntax and `name: value` entries.

  - **removed**; reason: we've decided on using `libconfig` for configuration files.
