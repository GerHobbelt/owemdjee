### TCL and their ilk

- **itcl** [📁](./itcl) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/itcl) -- Itcl is an object oriented extension for Tcl.
- **jimtcl** [📁](./jimtcl) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/jimtcl) -- the Jim Interpreter is a small-footprint implementation of the Tcl programming language written from scratch. Currently Jim Tcl is very feature complete with an extensive test suite (see the tests directory). There are some Tcl commands and features which are not implemented (and likely never will be), including traces and Tk. However, Jim Tcl offers a number of both Tcl8.5 and Tcl8.6 features ({*}, dict, lassign, tailcall and optional UTF-8 support) and some unique features. These unique features include [lambda] with garbage collection, a general GC/references system, arrays as syntax sugar for [dict]tionaries, object-based I/O and more. Other common features of the Tcl programming language are present, like the "everything is a string" behaviour, implemented internally as dual ported objects to ensure that the execution time does not reflect the semantic of the language :)
- **picol** [📁](./picol) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/picol) -- a tiny Tcl interpreter.
- **tcl** [📁](./tcl) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/tcl) -- the latest **Tcl** source distribution. Tcl provides a powerful platform for creating integration applications that tie together diverse applications, protocols, devices, and frameworks.
- **tclclockmod** [📁](./tclclockmod) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/tclclockmod) -- TclClockMod is the fastest, most powerful Tcl clock engine written in C. This Tcl clock extension is the faster Tcl-module for the replacement of the standard "clock" ensemble of tcl.
