- **open-location-code** [📁](./open-location-code) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/open-location-code) -- Open Location Code is a technology that gives a way of encoding location into a form that is easier to use than latitude and longitude. The codes generated are called plus codes, as their distinguishing attribute is that they include a "+" character.  The technology is designed to produce codes that can be used as a replacement for street addresses, especially in places where buildings aren't numbered or streets aren't named.  Plus codes represent an area, not a point. As digits are added to a code, the area shrinks, so a long code is more precise than a short code.  Codes that are similar are located closer together than codes that are different.
- **OTB** [📁](./OTB) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/OTB) -- Orfeo ToolBox (OTB) is an open-source project for state-of-the-art remote sensing. Built on the shoulders of the open-source geospatial community, it can process high resolution optical, multispectral and radar images at the terabyte scale. A wide variety of applications are available: from ortho-rectification or pansharpening, all the way to classification, SAR processing, and much more!

- **scws-chinese-word-segmentation** [📁](./scws-chinese-word-segmentation) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/scws) -- SCWS (Simple Chinese Word Segmentation) (i.e.: Simple Chinese Word Segmentation System). This is a mechanical Chinese word segmentation engine based on word frequency dictionary, which can basically correctly segment a whole paragraph of Chinese text into words. A word is the smallest morpheme unit in Chinese, but when writing, it does not separate words with spaces like English, so how to segment words accurately and quickly has always been a difficult problem in Chinese word segmentation. SCWS supports Chinese encoding includes `GBK`, `UTF-8`, etc.
  
  There are not many innovative elements in the word segmentation algorithm. It uses a word frequency dictionary collected by itself, supplemented by certain proper names, names of people, and place names. Basic word segmentation is achieved by identifying rules such as digital age. After small-scale testing, the accuracy is between 90% and 95%, which can basically satisfy some use in small search engines, keyword extraction and other occasions. The first prototype version was released in late 2005.

- **SheenBidi** [📁](./SheenBidi) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/SheenBidi) -- implements Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm available at http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9. It is a sophisticated implementation which provides the developers an easy way to use UBA in their applications.

- **unicode-inflection** [📁](./unicode-inflection) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/inflection) -- Code, data and documentation solving language inflection problems. [Inflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection) is the process of changing the form of a word to express different grammatical features, such as tense, number, gender, or case. In many languages, inflection is a complex and nuanced process, and it can be difficult to implement inflection correctly in software. This can lead to an inability to express native sounding sentences or to errors in text processing, such as incorrect word forms or incorrect grammatical agreement.
- **unpaper** [📁](./unpaper) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/unpaper) -- a post-processing tool for scanned sheets of paper, especially for book pages that have been scanned from previously created photocopies.  The main purpose is to make scanned book pages better readable on screen after conversion to PDF. The program also tries to detect misaligned centering and rotation of ages and will automatically straighten each page by rotating it to the correct angle (a.k.a. deskewing).
