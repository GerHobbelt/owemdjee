Lowest possible **run-time** cost, a.k.a. "run-time overhead": the aim is to have IPC which does not noticably impact UX (User Experience of the application: responsiveness / UI) on reeasonably powered machines. (Users are *not* expected to have the latest or fastest hardware.)

As *at least* large images will be transfered (PDF page renders) we need to have a binary-able protocol.
