### Forth et al

- **atlast** [📁](./atlast) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/atlast) -- ATLAST (Embedded Threaded Language Toolkit) is an attempt to make software component technology and open architecture applications commonplace in the mainstream software market. ATLAST is based upon the FORTH-83 language, but has been extended in many ways and modified to better serve its mission as an embedded toolkit for open, programmable applications.  ATLAST includes native support for floating point, C-like strings, Unix-compatible file access, and a wide variety of facilities for embedding within applications.  Integers are 32 bits (64 bits in the 64-bit version of ATLAST) and identifiers can be up to 127 characters; extensive stack and heap pointer checking is available to aid in debugging.
- **pforth** [📁](./pforth) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/pforth) -- PForth - a Portable ANS-like Forth written in ANSI 'C'. It only needs character input and output functions to operate and, therefore, does not require an operating system. This makes it handy for bringing up and testing embedded systems.
