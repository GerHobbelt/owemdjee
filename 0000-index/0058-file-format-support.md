- **libics** [📁](./libics) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/libics) -- the reference library for ICS (Image Cytometry Standard), an open standard for writing images of any dimensionality and data type to file, together with associated information regarding the recording equipment or recorded subject.
  
  ICS stands for Image Cytometry Standard, and was first proposed in: P. Dean, L. Mascio, D. Ow, D. Sudar, J. Mullikin, "Propsed standard for image cytometry data files", Cytometry, n.11, pp.561-569, 1990. 
  
  It writes 2 files, one is the header, with an '.ics' extension, and the other is the actual image data (with an '.ids' extension.)
  
  ICS version 2.0 extends this standard to allow for a more versatile placement of the image data. It can now be placed either in the same '.ics' file or inbedded in any other file, by specifying the file name and the byte offset for the data.
  
  The advantage of ICS over other open standards such as TIFF is that it allows data of any type and dimensionality to be stored. A TIFF file can contain a collection of 2D images; it's up to the user to determine how these relate to each other. An ICS file can contain, for exmaple, a 5D image in which the 4th dimension is the light frequency and the 5th time. Also, all of the information regarding the microscope settings (or whatever instument was used to acquire the image) and the sample preparation can be included in the file.

It was first included in the zlib distribution as an additional code contribution starting in zlib 1.1.2. Since that time, it has been continually improved upon and contributed to by many people. The original [project](https://github.com/madler/zlib/tree/master/contrib/minizip) can still be found in the zlib distribution that is maintained by Mark Adler.
- **netpbm** [📁](./netpbm) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/netpbm-mirror) -- a toolkit for manipulation of graphic images, including conversion of images between a variety of different formats.

  - ImageBuf and ImageBufAlgo functions, which constitute a simple class for storing and manipulating whole images in memory, plus a collection of the most useful computations you might want to do involving those images, including many image processing operations.
  
  The primary target audience for OIIO is VFX studios and developers of tools such as renderers, compositors, viewers, and other image-related software you'd find in a production pipeline.

- **openimageio-mupdf** [📁](./openimageio-mupdf) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/openimageio-mupdf) -- an [OpenImageIO](https://github.com/imageio/imageio) plugin for the mupdf library which enables us to read/fetch/view every page in a given PDF file as a ready-to-use image.

The Robots Exclusion Protocol (REP) is a standard that enables website owners to control which URLs may be accessed by automated clients (i.e. crawlers) through a simple text file with a specific syntax. It's one of the basic building blocks of the internet as we know it and what allows search engines to operate. Because the REP was only a de-facto standard for the past 25 years, different implementers implement parsing of robots.txt slightly differently, leading to confusion. This project aims to fix that by releasing the parser that Google uses.

- **xmunch** [📁](./xmunch) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/xmunch) -- xmunch essentially does, what the 'munch' command of, for example, hunspell does, but is not compatible with hunspell affix definition files. So why use it then? What makes xmunch different from the other tools is the ability to extend incomplete word-lists. For hunspell's munch to identify a stem and add an affix mark, every word formed by the affix with the stem has to be in the original word-list. This makes sense for a compression tool. However if your word list is incomplete, you have to add all possible word-forms of a word first, before any compression is done. Using xmunch instead, you can define a subset of forms which are required to be in the word-list to allow the word to be used as stem. Like this, you can extend the word-list.
- **zsv** [📁](./zsv) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/zsv) -- the world's fastest (SIMD) CSV parser, with an extensible CLI for SQL querying, format conversion and more.
- ~~**gmime** [🌐](https://github.com/jstedfast/gmime) (alternative repo [here](https://github.com/GNOME/gmime)) -- multipart MIME library; serves as a fundamental building block for full MHTML file format I/O support~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: GNOME libraries are horrible to integrate with other codebases.
