### Date & time functionality

- **cctz** [📁](./cctz) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/cctz) -- CCTZ contains two libraries that cooperate with `<chrono>` to give C++ programmers all the necessary tools for computing with dates, times, and time zones in a simple and correct manner.
- **date** [📁](./date) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/date) -- a combo of several separate C++11/C++14/C++17 libraries, all geared towards formatting and working with date and time stamps in human-centric formats.
- **datetimepp** [📁](./datetimepp) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/datetimepp) -- datetime++ is an attempt to port [Python Datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) to C++. Finally easy datetime management in C++ !
- **dateutils** [📁](./dateutils) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/dateutils) -- a bunch of tools that revolve around fiddling with dates and times on the command line with a strong focus on use cases that arise when dealing with large amounts of financial data.
- **libeternaltimestamp** [📁](./libeternaltimestamp) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/libeternaltimestamp) -- provide/encode/decode 64-bit integer timestamps which can encode *any* date/time in the lifetime of our planet from before the Big Bang up to about 3000 AD in the future.
