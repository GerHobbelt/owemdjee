### Igor's Lisp, Vetinari's Scheming, ...

- **chibi-scheme** [📁](./chibi-scheme) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/chibi-scheme) -- Chibi-Scheme is a very small library intended for use as an extension and scripting language in C programs.  In addition to support for lightweight VM-based threads, each VM itself runs in an isolated heap allowing multiple VMs to run simultaneously in different OS threads.
- **ecl** [📁](./ecl) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/ecl) -- ECL (Embeddable Common-Lisp) aims to produce an implementation of the Common-Lisp language which complies to the ANSI X3J13 definition of the language. ECL includes a Lisp to C compiler, which produces libraries (static or dynamic) that can be called from C programs. Furthermore, ECL can produce standalone executables from Lisp code and can itself be linked to your programs as a shared library. It also features an interpreter for situations when a C compiler isn't available.
- **guile** [📁](./guile) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/guile) -- Guile is Project GNU's extension language library. Guile is an implementation of the Scheme programming language, packaged as a library that can be linked into applications to give them their own extension language.  Guile supports other languages as well, giving users of Guile-based applications a choice of languages.
- **janet** [📁](./janet) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/janet) -- **Janet** is a (lispy) programming language for system scripting, expressive automation, and extending programs written in C or C++ with user scripting capabilities. Janet makes a good system scripting language, or a language to embed in other programs. It's like Lua and GNU Guile in that regard. It has more built-in functionality and a richer core language than Lua, but smaller than GNU Guile or Python. However, it is much easier to embed and port than Python or Guile.
- **newlisp** [📁](./newlisp) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/newlisp) -- newLISP is a LISP-like scripting language for doing things you typically do with scripting languages: programming for the internet, system administration, text processing, gluing other programs together, etc. newLISP is a scripting LISP for people who are fascinated by LISP's beauty and power of expression, but who need it stripped down to easy-to-learn essentials. newLISP is LISP reborn as a scripting language: pragmatic and casual, simple to learn without requiring you to know advanced computer science concepts. Like any good scripting language, newLISP is quick to get into and gets the job done without fuss. newLISP has a very fast startup time, is small on resources like disk space and memory and has a deep, practical API with functions for networking, statistics, machine learning, regular expressions, multiprocessing and distributed computing built right into it, not added as a second thought in external modules.
- **owl** [📁](./owl) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/owl) -- Owl Lisp is a functional dialect of the Scheme programming language. It is mainly based on the applicative subset of the R7RS standard.
- **sbcl** [📁](./sbcl) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/sbcl) -- SBCL is an implementation of ANSI Common Lisp, featuring a high-performance native compiler, native threads on several platforms, a socket interface, a source-level debugger, a statistical profiler, and much more.
