### graph analysis, graph databases

- **arangodb** [📁](./arangodb) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/arangodb) -- a scalable open-source multi-model database natively supporting graph, document and search. All supported data models & access patterns can be combined in queries allowing for maximal flexibility.
- **g2o** [📁](./g2o) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/g2o) -- General Graph Optimization (G2O) is a C++ framework for optimizing graph-based nonlinear error functions. g2o has been designed to be easily extensible to a wide range of problems and a new problem typically can be specified in a few lines of code. The current implementation provides solutions to several variants of SLAM and BA.
- **GraphBLAS** [📁](./GraphBLAS) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/GraphBLAS) -- SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS is a complete implementation of the GraphBLAS standard, which defines a set of sparse matrix operations on an extended algebra of semirings using an almost unlimited variety of operators and types.  When applied to sparse adjacency matrices, these algebraic operations are equivalent to computations on graphs.  GraphBLAS provides a powerful and expressive framework for creating graph algorithms based on the elegant mathematics of sparse matrix operations on a semiring.
- **graph-coloring** [📁](./graph-coloring) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/graph-coloring) -- a C++ Graph Coloring Package. This project has two primary uses:
  
  * As an executable for finding the chromatic number for an input graph (in edge list or edge matrix format)
  * As a library for finding the particular coloring of an input graph (represented as a `map<string,vector<string>>` edge list)

- **graphit** [📁](./graphit) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/graphit) -- a High-Performance Domain Specific Language for Graph Analytics.
- **kahypar** [📁](./kahypar) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/kahypar) -- KaHyPar (Karlsruhe Hypergraph Partitioning) is a multilevel hypergraph partitioning framework providing direct k-way and recursive bisection based partitioning algorithms that compute solutions of very high quality.
- **libgrape-lite** [📁](./libgrape-lite) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/libgrape-lite) -- a C++ library from Alibaba for parallel graph processing (GRAPE). It differs from prior systems in its ability to parallelize sequential graph algorithms as a whole by following the PIE programming model from GRAPE. Sequential algorithms can be easily "plugged into" `libgrape-lite` with only minor changes and get parallelized to handle large graphs efficiently. `libgrape-lite` is designed to be highly efficient and flexible, to cope with the scale, variety and complexity of real-life graph applications.
- **midas** [📁](./midas) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/MIDAS) -- C++ implementation of:
  
  - [MIDAS: Microcluster-Based Detector of Anomalies in Edge Streams](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.04464.pdf). *Siddharth Bhatia, Bryan Hooi, Minji Yoon, Kijung Shin, Christos Faloutsos*. AAAI 2020.
  - [Real-time Streaming Anomaly Detection in Dynamic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.08452.pdf). *Siddharth Bhatia, Rui Liu, Bryan Hooi, Minji Yoon, Kijung Shin, Christos Faloutsos*. TKDD 2022.

- **ogdf** [📁](./ogdf) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/ogdf) -- OGDF stands both for **O**pen **G**raph **D**rawing **F**ramework (the original name) and **O**pen **G**raph algorithms and **D**ata structures **F**ramework. OGDF is a self-contained C++ library for graph algorithms, in particular for (but not restricted to) automatic graph drawing. It offers sophisticated algorithms and data structures to use within your own applications or scientific projects.
- **snap** [📁](./snap) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/snap) -- Stanford Network Analysis Platform (SNAP) is a general purpose, high performance system for analysis and manipulation of large networks. SNAP scales to massive graphs with hundreds of millions of nodes and billions of edges.
