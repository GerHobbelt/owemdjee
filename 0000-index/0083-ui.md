## UI / GUI

- **agg** [📁](./agg) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/agg) -- Anti-Grain Geometry library, written by Maxim Shemanarev in C++. It is an Open Source, 2D vector graphics library. Agg produces pixel images in memory from vectorial data. AGG doesn't depend on any graphic API or technology. Basically, you can think of AGG as of a rendering engine that produces pixel images in memory from some vectorial data.

- **neutralinoJS** [📁](./neutralinoJS) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/neutralinojs) -- a lightweight and portable desktop application development framework. It lets you develop lightweight cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Neutralinojs offers a lightweight SDK which is an alternative for Electron and NW.js. Neutralinojs doesn't bundle Chromium and uses the existing web browser library in the operating system. Neutralinojs implements a WebSocket connection for native operations and embeds a static web server to serve the web content. Also, it offers a built-in [JavaScript client library](https://github.com/neutralinojs/neutralino.js) for developers.

- **nodesoup** [📁](./nodesoup) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/nodesoup) -- delivers graph untangling: a force-directed graph layout simulates forces to give motion to vertices and arrange them in a way that is visually pleasing and/or reveals structure. The Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm assigns a repelling force to vertices pair of the graph, effectively pushing apart vertices so they don't overlap, and a attraction force between each adjacent vertices pair, thus dragging closer connected vertices. The forces attenuate when the vertices get respectively further apart or closer, and a global temperature also serves as a simulated annealing, capping the maximum vertex displacement at each iteration. As the forces between each component and the temperature gradually diminish, the layout stabilizes.  Another method, the Kamada Kawai algorithm, relies on the simulation of springs between each vertex, which strength is determined by the length of the shortest path between both vertices. The potential energy of each vertex, i.e. the sum of the energy of all its springs, is then computed. The goal being to reduce the global energy of the layout, each vertex is moved step-by-step until its potential energy is considered low-enough, using a Newton-Raphson algorithm.
- **notcurses** [📁](./notcurses) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/notcurses) -- a library facilitating complex TUIs on modern terminal emulators, supporting vivid colors, multimedia, threads, and Unicode to the maximum degree possible.

- **oof** [📁](./oof) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/oof) -- OOF (omnipotent output friend) is a single C++20 header that wraps so-called [Virtual Terminal sequences](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/console-virtual-terminal-sequences) (sometimes also confusingly called ["escape codes"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code)) in a convenient way, enabling console applications using OOF to be far more capable than usual: complete control over position, color and other properties of written characters.
- **photino.native** [📁](./photino.native) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/photino.Native) -- a lightweight open-source framework for building native, cross-platform desktop applications with Web UI technology.
