### decision trees

- **catboost** [📁](./catboost) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/catboost) -- a fast, scalable, high performance Gradient Boosting on Decision Trees library, used for ranking, classification, regression and other machine learning tasks. Supports computation on CPU and GPU.
- **decision-tree** [📁](./decision-tree) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/decision-tree) -- a decision tree classifier. Decision trees are a simple machine learning algorithm that use a series of features of an observation to create a prediction of a target outcome class.
- **random-forest** [📁](./random-forest) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/random-forest) -- a Fast C++ Implementation of Random Forests as described in: Leo Breiman. Random Forests. Machine Learning 45(1):5-32, 2001.
- **Sherwood** [📁](./Sherwood) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/Sherwood) -- Sherwood: a library for decision forest inference, which was written by Duncan Robertson to accompany the book "A. Criminisi and J. Shotton. Decision Forests: for Computer Vision and Medical Image Analysis. Springer,  2013." The Sherwood library comprises a general purpose, object-oriented software framework for applying decision forests to a wide range of inference problems.
- **treelite** [📁](./treelite) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/treelite) -- **Treelite** is a universal model exchange and serialization format for decision tree forests. Treelite aims to be a small library that enables other C++ applications to exchange and store decision trees on the disk as well as the network.
- **yggdrasil-decision-forests** [📁](./yggdrasil-decision-forests) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/yggdrasil-decision-forests) -- Yggdrasil Decision Forests (YDF) is a production-grade collection of algorithms for the training, serving, and interpretation of decision forest models. YDF is open-source and is available in C++, command-line interface (CLI), TensorFlow (under the name [TensorFlow Decision Forests](https://github.com/tensorflow/decision-forests); TF-DF), JavaScript (inference only), and Go (inference only).
