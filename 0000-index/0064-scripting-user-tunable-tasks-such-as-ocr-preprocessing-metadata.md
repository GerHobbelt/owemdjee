## scripting *user-tunable tasks* such as OCR preprocessing, metadata extraction, metadata cleaning & other \[post-\]processing, ...

- **asp** [📁](./asp) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/asp) -- the Asp Scripting Platform for Embedded Systems resembles basic Python (with some small differences), making it easy to learn for those who are already familiar with Python. It supports conditionals (if/elif/else), loops (while, for), and functions. It supports basic data types plus tuples, lists, sets, dictionaries, and ranges/slices. To keep things small, Asp does not support classes, exception handling, and many other advanced features. Scripts are compiled to compact byte-code, which is checked for compatibility with the application before being allowed to run in the engine.  The Asp engine has a small code memory footprint (less than 100 KB when compiled optimizing for space). It avoids use of dynamic memory allocation and recursion, resulting in very little impact on the memory of the host application. Applications run scripts one instruction at a time, retaining a high frequency of control of the CPU.
- **atlast** [📁](./atlast) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/atlast) -- ATLAST (Embedded Threaded Language Toolkit) is an attempt to make software component technology and open architecture applications commonplace in the mainstream software market.

Atlast includes native support for floating point, C-like strings, Unix-compatible file access, and a wide variety of facilities for embedding within applications.  Integers are 32 bits (64 bits in the 64-bit version of Atlast) and identifiers can be up to 127 characters; extensive stack and heap pointer checking is available to aid in debugging.

Bestline is a fork of [linenoise](https://github.com/antirez/linenoise/) (a popular GNU Readline alternative) that fixes its bugs and adds the missing features: you can finally have a permissively-licensed command prompt w/ a 38kb footprint that's nearly as good as GNU Readline.

- **jimtcl** [📁](./jimtcl) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/jimtcl) -- the Jim Interpreter is a small-footprint implementation of the Tcl programming language written from scratch. Currently Jim Tcl is very feature complete with an extensive test suite (see the tests directory). There are some Tcl commands and features which are not implemented (and likely never will be), including traces and Tk. However, Jim Tcl offers a number of both Tcl8.5 and Tcl8.6 features ({*}, dict, lassign, tailcall and optional UTF-8 support) and some unique features. These unique features include [lambda] with garbage collection, a general GC/references system, arrays as syntax sugar for [dict]tionaries, object-based I/O and more. Other common features of the Tcl programming language are present, like the "everything is a string" behaviour, implemented internally as dual ported objects to ensure that the execution time does not reflect the semantic of the language :)

- ~~**CPython** [🌐](https://github.com/python/cpython)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: we've decided to offer any application user facing scripting features in JavaScript only: Python and the others can use socket-based messaging when someone wants to write their user scripts in any of those languages.


The additional (and more important) reason to ditch CPython from the R&D set is hairiness of integrating Python into an application as an embedded scripting language, instead of the other way around. With the envisioned advent of ZeroMQ/socket based IPC, any Python scripts can hook into that instead of spending the effort and maintenance of having that large language as an embedded 'assistive' scripting/configuration language: it's simply too huge and complicated. We're not Blender and we don't have the funding.

- **DataFrame** [📁](./DataFrame) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/DataFrame) -- a C++ analytical library designed for data analysis similar to libraries in Python and R. For example, you would compare this to [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) or [R data.frame](https://www.w3schools.com/r/r_data_frames.asp). The depth and breadth of functionalities offered by C++ DataFrame alone are many times greater than functionalities offered by packages such as Pandas, data.frame, and Polars combined. You can slice the data in many different ways. You can join, merge, group-by the data. You can run various statistical, summarization, financial, and ML algorithms on the data. You can add your custom algorithms easily. You can multi-column sort, custom pick and delete the data. And more …
