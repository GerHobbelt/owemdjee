- **libuuid** [📁](./libuuid) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/libuuid) -- a library to generate unique identifiers for objects that may be accessible beyond the local system. The UUIDs generated by this library can be reasonably expected to be unique within a system, and unique across all systems. They could be used, for instance, to generate unique HTTP cookies across multiple web servers without communication between the servers, and without fear of a name clash.
- **libzint** [📁](./libzint) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/libzint) -- Zint is a suite of programs to allow easy encoding of data in any of the wide range of public domain barcode standards.

- **logger_benchmarks** [📁](./logger_benchmarks) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/logger_benchmarks) -- benchmarking several C++ logging libraries.
- **lsnms** [📁](./lsnms) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/lsnms) -- LSNMS speeds up Non Maximum Suppression with multiclass support ran on very large images by a several folds factor, using a sparse implementation of NMS (Non-Metric Space), used in similarity search. This project becomes useful in the case of very high dimensional image data when the amount of predicted instances to prune becomes considerable (> 10,000 objects).
- **luple** [📁](./luple) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/luple) -- provides C++ Type Loophole, luple, nuple, C++ String Interning, Struct Reader. Luple is a tuple-like data structure. Its primary advantage is that it's very thin and also non-recursive (uses multiple inheritance). std::tuple is usually implemented as a single inheritance hierarchy and as a result its layout can vary between compilers. Also it stores data in reverse order. Luple is built on multiple inheritance and its layout is consistent among compilers. It has the same layout as a non-virtual flat data structure with the same data members (formally luple is not a POD and we should keep that in mind when we reinterpret\_cast it). Luple can be used in constexpr functions if its data members are of literal type.   nuple extends luple and allows giving names to data members.   Struct Reader can detect and create a type list of the data member types of a flat data structure if they are literal, non-const/non-reference types. So, it's a form of primitive RTTI.
- **LZMA-Vizualizer** [📁](./LZMA-Vizualizer) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/LZMA-Vizualizer) -- visualises per-byte perplexity of the compressed data in an LZMA file.

- **mechascribe** [📁](./mechascribe) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/mechascribe) -- a text rendering abstraction trying to support as much scripts as possible by combining the best publicly available libraries. Features support for complex text layout (using the `raqm` library), feature-complete rendering (using Freetype), very fast software rendering, modern 2-step CPU+GPU rendering, simplified distribution of the Noto fonts for extensive unicode coverage and completely independent font fallback management. The first step to supporting as much scripts as possible consists in gathering a set of fonts covering all the required glyphs. The Noto fonts were created by Google to solve this exact issue. The complete collection weights more than 1.5GiB, but keeping only the regular-weight variable-width sans-serif variants makes it only 74MiB. Zstd compression can help us reduce its size even further: using its most aggressive parameters, our set can be made to fit a 16MiB file. While the compression takes quite some time even on a powerful computer, the resulting archive still unpacks almost instantaneously.
- **memory** [📁](./memory) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/memory) -- the C++ STL allocator model has various flaws. For example, they are fixed to a certain type, because they are almost necessarily required to be templates. So you can't easily share a single allocator for multiple types. In addition, you can only get a copy from the containers and not the original allocator object. At least with C++11 they are allowed to be stateful and so can be made object not instance based. But still, the model has many flaws. Over the course of the years many solutions have been proposed, for example [EASTL]. This library is another. But instead of trying to change the STL, it works with the current implementation.
- **merror** [📁](./merror) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/merror) -- **MError** C++ Macro Error Handling Library is a library for error handling in C++ without exceptions. It requires C++17 and only works for gcc or clang compilers.

The executed kernel is customized on a range of different operational intensity values. Modern GPUs are able to hide memory latency by switching execution to threads able to perform compute operations. Using this tool one can assess the practical optimum balance in both types of operations for a compute device. CUDA, HIP, OpenCL and SYCL implementations have been developed, targeting GPUs, or OpenMP when using a CPU as a target.

Its main goal is generating fast lexers: at least as fast as their reasonably optimized hand-coded counterparts. Instead of using traditional table-driven approach, re2c encodes the generated finite state automata directly in the form of conditional jumps and comparisons. The resulting programs are faster and often smaller than their table-driven analogues, and they are much easier to debug and understand. re2c applies quite a few optimizations in order to speed up and compress the generated code.  Another distinctive feature is its flexible interface: instead of assuming a fixed program template, re2c lets the programmer write most of the interface code and adapt the generated lexer to any particular environment.
- **ReactivePlusPlus** [📁](./ReactivePlusPlus) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/ReactivePlusPlus) -- a reactive programming library for C++20 language inspired by "official implementation" ([RxCpp](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxCpp)) and original idea ([ReactiveX](https://reactivex.io/)) that only depends on standard library and C++20 features (mostly on [concepts](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constraints)).

  The RE/flex matcher tracks line numbers, column numbers, and indentations, whereas Flex does not (option `noyylineno`) and neither do the other regex matchers (except PCRE2 and Boost.Regex when used with RE/flex).
  Tracking this information incurs some overhead. RE/flex also automatically decodes UTF-8/16/32 input and accepts `std::istream`, strings, and wide strings as input.
  
  RE/flex runs equally fast or slightly faster than the best times of Flex.

  On MS Windows the Windows API is used instead of escape codes but some limitations apply (not everything is supported). That's why it's recommended to enter virtual terminal processing mode and set the TERMCOLOR_USE_ANSI_ESCAPE_SEQUENCES macro to trick termcolor to use ANSI color codes.

This allows smeared time to be stored and distributed exclusively, then converted to and from other timescales in applications where the smear's 11.6 ppm frequency change is consequential. No parallel time distribution systems are required, nor is any mechanism necessary for a system to record what timescale its system clock is using. In other words, the smear is not a way of approximately smudging the clock; it is a defined, precise, and reversible conversion. Rather than having seconds of constant length and minutes with a variable number of seconds, there are always 60 seconds in a minute and the length of a second sometimes differs from those of TAI.
