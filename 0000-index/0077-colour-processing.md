- **colorm** [📁](./colorm) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/colorm) -- ColorM is a C++11 header-only color conversion and manipulation library for [CSS colors](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/) with an API similar to [chroma.js](https://github.com/gka/chroma.js/)'s API.
- **ColorMagic** [📁](./ColorMagic) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/ColorMagic) -- a C++ Library that allows manipulation and conversion of colors. Supports these Color Spaces: RGB/A, Grey/A, CMYK, HSV, HSL, XYZ, XYY, CieLUV, Lab. Supports adding, mixing, averaging and subtracting colors (optionally with weights), calculating color distances (Euclidean, CMC, CIELAB76, CIELAB94, CIELAB2000), creating color sets (Complementary, Triplet, Quartet, Quintet, Analogous, Complementary Split, Custom) & adjusting colors (Saturate, Desaturate, Lighten, Unlighten).
- **colormap-tools** [📁](./colormap-tools) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/colormap-tools) -- read, manage & generate colors, colormaps and color gradients for various other applications (gnuplot, Photoshop, ...), in diverse output formats and color spaces (sRGB, OKLab, CMYK, ...). Also provide a C++ API for the same functionality, i.e. also serve as an in-app library providing these services.
- **ColorPaletteCodable** [📁](./ColorPaletteCodable) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/ColorPaletteCodable) -- a color palette reader/editor/writer package for iOS, macOS, macCatalyst, tvOS, watchOS and Linux. Supports many palette formats, including Adobe Swatch Exchange (`.ase`), Adobe Photoshop Color Swatch (`.aco`), Adobe Color Table (`.act`) and Microsoft RIFF palette files (`.pal`)
- **gencolormap** [📁](./gencolormap) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/gencolormap) -- generate color maps for visualization. A variety of methods for sequential, diverging, and qualitative maps is available.
- **hsluv-color-gradient** [📁](./hsluv-color-gradient) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/hsluv-color-gradient) -- 1D discrete and continous perceptually uniform ordered color gradients rendered in [HSL](https://www.hsluv.org/)
- **libase** [📁](./libase) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/libase) -- a tiny library for interpreting the Adobe Swatch Exchange (`.ase`) file format for color palettes since Adobe Creative Suite 3.
- **libccpalette** [📁](./libccpalette) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/libccpalette) -- a C++ library to load, save, pick and interpolate colors from any color palette.
- **lterpalettefinder** [📁](./lterpalettefinder) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/lterpalettefinder) -- extract Color Palettes from Photos and Pick Official LTER Palettes. The goal of `lterpalettefinder` is to provide high quality color palettes derived from photos at Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites. This allows users to create beautiful graphics that have close visual ties to photos from the places where data were collected. This package also allows users to generate their own palettes from any photo (PNG, JPEG, TIFF, or HEIC) if the current palettes in the function do not meet their needs. For more information on the LTER Network, check out [our website](https://lternet.edu/)!
- **MetBrewer** [📁](./MetBrewer) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/MetBrewer) -- palettes inspired by works at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Pieces selected come from various time periods, regions, and mediums.
- **PNWColors** [📁](./PNWColors) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/PNWColors) -- Four years spent in the most beautiful place in the world, immortalized in an R color palette package. May the colors of Washington State and the Pacific Northwest live on in our presentation figures forever.  Palettes are pulled from photos I took in some of the dreamiest, most colorful, PNW-iest places I know.
- **we-love-colors** [📁](./we-love-colors) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/we-love-colors) -- a library to easily generate **color palettes**.
- **yy_color_convertor** [📁](./yy_color_convertor) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/yy_color_convertor) -- convert color between RGB,HSL,HSB,CMYK,YUV,YIQ,XYZ,xyY,Lab,Luv,LCH ...
