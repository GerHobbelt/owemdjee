- **magika** [📁](./magika) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/magika) -- is a novel AI-powered file type detection tool that relies on the recent advance of deep learning to provide accurate detection. Under the hood, Magika employs a custom, highly optimized model that only weighs about a few MBs, and enables precise file identification within milliseconds, even when running on a single CPU. Magika has been trained and evaluated on a dataset of ~100M samples across 200+ content types (covering both binary and textual file formats), and it achieves an average ~99% accuracy on our test set.
- **marisa-trie** [📁](./marisa-trie) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/marisa-trie) -- Matching Algorithm with Recursively Implemented StorAge (MARISA) is a static and space-efficient trie data structure. `libmarisa` also contains a set of command line tools for building and operating a MARISA-based dictionary, which supports not only lookup but also reverse lookup (restore a key from its ID), common prefix search (find keys from prefixes of a given string) and predictive search (find keys starting with a given string). The biggest advantage of libmarisa is that its dictionary size is considerably more compact than others.
