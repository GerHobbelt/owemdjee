### run-time library core features: logging, formatting, ...

- **binary_log** [📁](./binary_log) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/binary_log) -- a fast C++20 library which logs messages in a compact binary format while using [fmtlib](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) to format the logs.
- **cfgpath** [📁](./cfgpath) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/cfgpath) -- cross platform methods for obtaining paths to configuration files
- **clp** [📁](./clp) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/clp) -- YScope's Compressed Log Processor (CLP) compresses your logs, and allows you to search the compressed logs without decompression. CLP supports both JSON logs and unstructured (i.e., free text) logs. It also supports real-time log compression within several logging libraries. CLP also includes purpose-built web interfaces for searching and viewing the compressed logs.
- **cpptrace** [📁](./cpptrace) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/cpptrace) -- a simple and portable C++ stacktrace library supporting C++11 and greater on Linux, macOS, and Windows including MinGW and Cygwin environments. The goal: Make stack traces simple for once.
- **detect-character-encoding** [📁](./detect-character-encoding) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/detect-character-encoding) -- detect character encoding using [ICU](http://site.icu-project.org).  **Tip:** If you don’t need ICU in particular, consider using [ced](https://github.com/sonicdoe/ced), which is based on Google’s lighter [compact_enc_det](https://github.com/google/compact_enc_det) library.
- **detox** [📁](./detox) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/detox) -- renames files to make them easier to work with under Linux and other Unix-like operating systems.  Spaces and various other unsafe characters (such as "`$`") get replaced with "`_`".  The upper portion of ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1) can be transcoded to UTF-8, as can CP-1252.
- **dunce** [📁](./dunce) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/dunce) -- Dunce (de-UNC): in Windows the regular paths (`C:\foo`) are supported by all programs, but have lots of bizarre restrictions for backwards compatibility with MS-DOS. There are also Windows NT UNC paths (`\\?\C:\foo`), which are more robust and with fewer gotchas, but are rarely supported by Windows programs — even Microsoft's own! Dunce converts Windows UNC paths to the MS-DOS-compatible format whenever possible, but leaves UNC paths as-is when they can't be unambiguously expressed in a simpler way. This allows legacy programs to access all paths they can possibly access, and doesn't break any paths for UNC-aware programs. For example, `\\?\C:\Windows` will be converted to `C:\Windows`, but `\\?\C:\COM` will be left as-is, because it contains a reserved filename.  Dunce's handling of UNC paths is safer than just unconditionally stripping the `\\` prefix, because naively stripped UNC paths with hostnames change to relative directory paths. There are
- **easyloggingpp** [📁](./easyloggingpp) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/easyloggingpp) -- Easylogging++ is single header efficient logging library for C++ applications. It is extremely powerful, highly extendable and configurable to user's requirements. It provides ability to write your own _sinks_ (via a feature referred as `LogDispatchCallback`).

- **fast_double_parser** [📁](./fast_double_parser) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/fast_double_parser) -- 4x faster than `strtod()`. Unless you need support for [RFC 7159](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159) (JSON standard), we encourage users to adopt [fast_float](https://github.com/fastfloat/fast_float) library instead. It has more functionality. Fast function to parse ASCII strings containing decimal numbers into double-precision (binary64) floating-point values.  That is, given the string "1.0e10", it should return a 64-bit floating-point value equal to 10000000000. We do not sacrifice accuracy. The function will match exactly (down the smallest bit) the result of a standard function like `strtod`.
- **fast_float** [📁](./fast_float) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/fast_float) -- fast and exact implementation of the C++ `from_chars` functions for float and double types: 4x faster than `strtod`

- **stx-error-handling** [📁](./stx-error-handling) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/STX) -- C++ 17 & C++ 20 error-handling and utility extensions.
- **TraceETW** [📁](./TraceETW) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/TraceEtw) -- [Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa363668(v=vs.85).aspx) is  powerful but notoriously complex. In C#, [EventSource](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.tracing.eventsource(v=vs.110).aspx) made that technology much more approachable. This project aims at providing a similar solution for C++, both for Desktop apps and for Windows/Windows Phone Universal Store apps.
- **tscns** [📁](./tscns) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/tscns) -- What's the problem with clock_gettime/gettimeofday/std::chrono::XXX_clock? Although current Linux systems are using VDSO to implement clock_gettime/gettimeofday/std::chrono::XXX_clock, they still have a nonnegligible overhead with latency from 20 to 100 ns. The problem is even worse on Windows as the latency is more unstable and could be as high as 1 us. Also on Windows, the high resolution clock is at only 100 ns precision. These problems are not good for time-critical tasks where high precison timestamp is required and latency of getting timestamp itself should be minimized.  TSCNS uses `rdtsc` instruction and simple arithmetic operations to implement a thread-safe clock with 1 ns precision, and is much faster and stable in terms of latency at less than 10 ns, comprising latency of `rdtsc` (4 ~ 7 ns depending on platforms) plus calculations in less than 1 ns.  TSCNS can be closely synchronized with the system clock, which makes it a good alternative of standard system clocks. However, real-time synchronization requires the clock to be calibrated at a proper interval, but it's a easy and cheap job to do.
- **utf8proc** [📁](./utf8proc) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/utf8proc) -- [utf8proc](http://juliastrings.github.io/utf8proc/) is a small, clean C library that provides Unicode normalization, case-folding, and other operations for data in the [UTF-8 encoding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8).

- **WinToast** [📁](./WinToast) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/WinToast) -- a library which delivers a complete integration of the modern **toast notifications** of **Windows 8**, **Windows 10** and **Windows 11**.  Toast notifications allows your app to inform the users about relevant information and timely events that they should see and take action upon inside your app, such as a new instant message, a new friend request, breaking news, or a calendar event.
- ~~**merror** [📁](./merror) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/merror) -- a library for error handling in C++ without exceptions.~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: code is non-portable to compilers other than GCC, or at least would require more effort than we're willing to expend on this.
