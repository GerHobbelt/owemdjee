It also creates large read-only file-based data structures that are `mmap`-ped into memory so that many processes may share the same data. ANNOY is almost as fast as the fastest libraries, but what really sets Annoy apart is: it has the ability to use static files as indexes, enabling you to share an index across processes. ANNOY also decouples creating indexes from loading them, so you can pass around indexes as files and map them into memory quickly. ANNOY tries to minimize its memory footprint: the indexes are quite small. This is useful when you want to find nearest neighbors using multiple CPU's. Spotify uses ANNOY for music recommendations.

- **baobzi** [📁](./baobzi) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/baobzi) -- an adaptive fast function approximator based on tree search. Word salad aside, `baobzi` is a tool to convert very CPU intensive function calculations into relatively cheap ones (at the cost of memory). This is similar to functions like `chebeval` in `MATLAB`, but can be significantly faster since the order of the polynomial fit can be much much lower to meet similar tolerances. It also isn't constrained for use only in `MATLAB`. Internally, `baobzi` represents your function by a grid of binary/quad/oct/N trees, where the leaves represent the function in some small sub-box of the function's domain with chebyshev polynomials. When you evaluate your function at a point with baobzi, it searches the tree for the box containing your point and evaluates using this approximant.

BCF reduces the average number of relocations of the state-of-the-art CF by 35%.
  
  - **left-for-dead**; reason: has some GCC + Linux specific coding constructs: intrinsics + Linux-only API calls, which increase the cost of porting.

- **bebop** [📁](./bebop) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/bebop) -- an extremely simple, fast, efficient, cross-platform serialization format. Bebop is a schema-based binary serialization technology, similar to Protocol Buffers or MessagePack.

At its core, BlazingMQ provides durable, fault-tolerant, highly performant, and highly available queues, along with features like various message routing strategies (e.g., work queues, priority, fan-out, broadcast, etc.), compression, strong consistency, poison pill detection, etc.  Message queues generally provide a loosely-coupled, asynchronous communication channel ("queue") between application services (producers and consumers) that send messages to one another. You can think about it like a mailbox for communication between application programs, where 'producer' drops a message in a mailbox and 'consumer' picks it up at its own leisure. Messages placed into the queue are stored until the recipient retrieves and processes them. In other words, producer and consumer applications can temporally and spatially isolate themselves from each other by using a message queue to facilitate communication.

- **cuckoofilter** [📁](./cuckoofilter) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/cuckoofilter) -- a key-value filter using cuckoo hashing, a Bloom filter replacement for approximated set-membership queries. While Bloom filters are well-known space-efficient data structures to serve queries like "if item x is in a set?", they do not support deletion. Their variances to enable deletion (like counting Bloom filters) usually require much more space.  Cuckoo ﬁlters provide the ﬂexibility to add and remove items dynamically. A cuckoo filter is based on cuckoo hashing (and therefore named as cuckoo filter).  It is essentially a cuckoo hash table storing each key's fingerprint. Cuckoo hash tables can be highly compact, thus a cuckoo filter could use less space than conventional Bloom ﬁlters, for applications that require low false positive rates (< 3%).
- **Cuckoo_Filter_simple** [📁](./Cuckoo_Filter_simple) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/Cuckoo_Filter) -- a key-value filter using cuckoo hashing, substituting for bloom filter.
- **cuckoo-index** [📁](./cuckoo-index) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/cuckoo-index) -- Cuckoo Index (CI) is a lightweight secondary index structure that represents the many-to-many relationship between keys and partitions of columns in a highly space-efficient way. CI associates variable-sized fingerprints in a Cuckoo filter with compressed bitmaps indicating qualifying partitions. The problem of finding all partitions that possibly contain a given lookup key is traditionally solved by maintaining one filter (e.g., a Bloom filter) per partition that indexes all unique key values contained in this partition. To identify all partitions containing a key, we would need to probe all per-partition filters (which could be many). Depending on the storage medium, a false positive there can be very expensive. Furthermore, secondary columns typically contain many duplicates (also across partitions). Cuckoo Index (CI) addresses these drawbacks of per-partition filters. (It must know all keys at build time, though.)

- **CurvatureFilter** [📁](./CurvatureFilter) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/CurvatureFilter) -- Curvature filters are efficient solvers for variational models. Traditional solvers, such as gradient descent or Euler Lagrange Equation, start at the total energy and use diffusion scheme to carry out the minimization. When the initial condition is the original image, the data fitting energy always increases while the regularization energy always reduces during the optimization, as illustrated in the below figure. Thus, regularization energy must be the dominant part since the total energy has to decrease. Therefore, **Curvature filters focus on minimizing the regularization term,** whose minimizers are already known. For example, if the regularization is Gaussian curvature, the developable surfaces minimize this energy. Therefore, in curvature filter, developable surfaces are used to approximate the data. **As long as the decreased amount in the regularization part is larger than the increased amount in the data fitting energy, the total energy is reduced.**

- **delegate** [📁](./delegate) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/delegate) -- an embedded friendly alternative to `std::function`. The main purpose is to store callable things such as free functions, member functions, and functors. Once stored, the delegate can be called without knowledge of the type of stored thing. The `delegate` guarantees no heap allocation and [is `trivially_copyable`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/TriviallyCopyable). It will never throw exceptions itself. Intended use is as general callback storage (think function pointer analog). The price to pay is that the delegate only stores a pointer to referenced functor objects or objects to call member functions on. The user needs to handle the lifetime of a referred object. In addition, the delegation object has a smaller footprint compared to common `std::function` implementations, using only 2 pointers (free function pointer and void pointer). This is small enough so that a delegate will use small object optimization.

- **dunce** [📁](./dunce) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/dunce) -- Dunce (de-UNC): in Windows the regular paths (`C:\foo`) are supported by all programs, but have lots of bizarre restrictions for backwards compatibility with MS-DOS. There are also Windows NT UNC paths (`\\?\C:\foo`), which are more robust and with fewer gotchas, but are rarely supported by Windows programs — even Microsoft's own! Dunce converts Windows UNC paths to the MS-DOS-compatible format whenever possible, but leaves UNC paths as-is when they can't be unambiguously expressed in a simpler way. This allows legacy programs to access all paths they can possibly access, and doesn't break any paths for UNC-aware programs. For example, `\\?\C:\Windows` will be converted to `C:\Windows`, but `\\?\C:\COM` will be left as-is, because it contains a reserved filename.  Dunce's handling of UNC paths is safer than just unconditionally stripping the `\\` prefix, because naively stripped UNC paths with hostnames change to relative directory paths. There are other normalization rules, special characters, and length limits that could change meaning of the path. Parsing is based on <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365247(v=vs.85).aspx>.

[`std::expected`](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0323r3.pdf) is proposed as the preferred way to represent object which will either have an expected value, or an unexpected value giving information about why something failed. Unfortunately, chaining together many computations which may fail can be verbose, as error-checking code will be mixed in with the actual programming logic. This implementation provides a number of utilities to make coding with `expected` cleaner.

An Eytzinger map, or BFS(breadth-first search) map, places elements in a lookup order, which leads to a better memory locality. In practice, such container can outperform searching in sorted arrays, like `boost::flat_map`, due to less cache misses made in a lookup process. In comparison with RB-based trees, like `std::map`, lookup in Eytzinger map can be multiple times faster. Some comparison graphs are [given here](https://kazakov.life/2017/03/06/cache-friendly-associative-container/).

See also the PVLDB paper https://github.com/cwida/fsst/raw/master/fsstcompression.pdf. FSST is a compression scheme focused on string/text data: it can compress strings from distributions with many different values (i.e. where dictionary compression will not work well). It allows *random-access* to compressed data: it is not block-based, so individual strings can be decompressed without touching the surrounding data in a compressed block. When compared to e.g. LZ4 (which is block-based), FSST further achieves similar decompression speed and compression speed, and better compression ratio. FSST encodes strings using a symbol table -- but it works on pieces of the string, as it maps "symbols" (1-8 byte sequences) onto "codes" (single-bytes). FSST can also represent a byte as an exception (255 followed by the original byte). Hence, compression transforms a sequence of bytes into a (supposedly shorter) sequence of codes or escaped bytes. These shorter byte-sequences could be seen as strings again and fit in whatever your program is that manipulates strings. An optional 0-terminated mode (like, C-strings) is also supported.

The original GIF codecs were written for a much different world and took great pains to use as little memory as possible and to accommodate a slow and unreliable input stream of data. Those constraints are no longer a problem for the vast majority of users and they were hurting the performance. Another feature holding back the performance of the original GIFLIB was that the original codec was designed to work with image data a line at a time and used a separate LZW dictionary to manage the strings of repeating symbols. My codec uses the output image as the dictionary; this allows much faster 'unwinding' of the codes since they are all stored in the right direction to just be copied to the new location.

- **libics** [📁](./libics) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/libics) -- the reference library for ICS (Image Cytometry Standard), an open standard for writing images of any dimensionality and data type to file, together with associated information regarding the recording equipment or recorded subject.
  
  ICS stands for Image Cytometry Standard, and was first proposed in: P. Dean, L. Mascio, D. Ow, D. Sudar, J. Mullikin, "Propsed standard for image cytometry data files", Cytometry, n.11, pp.561-569, 1990. 
  
  It writes 2 files, one is the header, with an '.ics' extension, and the other is the actual image data (with an '.ids' extension.)
  
  ICS version 2.0 extends this standard to allow for a more versatile placement of the image data. It can now be placed either in the same '.ics' file or inbedded in any other file, by specifying the file name and the byte offset for the data.
  
  The advantage of ICS over other open standards such as TIFF is that it allows data of any type and dimensionality to be stored. A TIFF file can contain a collection of 2D images; it's up to the user to determine how these relate to each other. An ICS file can contain, for exmaple, a 5D image in which the 4th dimension is the light frequency and the 5th time. Also, all of the information regarding the microscope settings (or whatever instument was used to acquire the image) and the sample preparation can be included in the file.

  SQLite has solidified its place in modern technology stacks, embedded in nearly any computing device you can think of. Its open source nature and public domain availability make it a popular choice for modification to meet specific use cases.
  But despite having its code available, SQLite famously doesn't accept external contributors, so community improvements cannot be widely enjoyed.
  There have been other forks in the past, but they all focus on a specific technical difference. We aim to be a community where people can contribute from many different angles and motivations.

Its primary advantage is that it's very thin and also non-recursive (uses multiple inheritance). std::tuple is usually implemented as a single inheritance hierarchy and as a result its layout can vary between compilers. Also it stores data in reverse order. Luple is built on multiple inheritance and its layout is consistent among compilers. It has the same layout as a non-virtual flat data structure with the same data members (formally luple is not a POD and we should keep that in mind when we reinterpret\_cast it). Luple can be used in constexpr functions if its data members are of literal type.   nuple extends luple and allows giving names to data members.   Struct Reader can detect and create a type list of the data member types of a flat data structure if they are literal, non-const/non-reference types. So, it's a form of primitive RTTI.

- **manticore-columnar** [📁](./manticore-columnar) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/columnar) -- Manticore Columnar Library is a column-oriented storage and secondary indexing library, aiming to provide **decent performance with low memory footprint at big data volume**. When used in combination with [Manticore Search](https://github.com/manticoresoftware/manticoresearch) it can be beneficial for those looking for:
  
  1. log analytics including rich free text search capabities (which is missing in e.g. [Clickhouse](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse) - great tool for metrics analytics)
  2. faster / low resource consumption log/metrics analytics. Since the library and Manticore Search are both written in C++ with low optimizations in mind, in many cases the performance / RAM consumption is better than in Lucene / SOLR / Elasticsearch
  3. running log / metric analytics in docker / kubernetes. Manticore Search + the library can work with as little as 30 megabytes of RAM which Elasticsearch / Clickhouse can't. It also starts in less than a second or a few seconds in the worst case. Since the overhead is so little you can afford having more nodes of Manticore Search + the library than Elasticsearch. More nodes and quicker start means higher high availability and agility.
  4. powerful SQL for logs/metrics analytics and everything else [Manticore Search](https://github.com/manticoresoftware/manticoresearch) can give you

  * Modern MPP architecture and smart query parallelization capabilities allow to fully utilize all your CPU cores to **lower response time** as much as possible, when needed.
  * Powerful and fast full-text search which **works fine for small and big datasets**
  * Traditional **row-wise storage** for small, medium and big size datasets
  * **Columnar storage** support via the [Manticore Columnar Library](https://github.com/manticoresoftware/columnar/) for bigger datasets (much bigger than can fit in RAM)
  * Easy to use secondary indexes (you don't need to create them manually)
  * Cost-based optimizer for search queries
  * SQL-first: Manticore's **native syntax is SQL**. It speaks SQL over HTTP and uses the MySQL protocol (you can use your preferred MySQL client)
  * **JSON over HTTP**: to provide a more programmatic way to manage your data and schemas, Manticore provides a HTTP JSON protocol
  * Written fully in C++: **starts fast, doesn't take much RAM**, and low-level optimizations provide good performance
  * **Real-time inserts**: after an INSERT is made, the document is accessible immediately
  * [Interactive courses](https://play.manticoresearch.com/) for **easier learning**
  * **Built-in replication and load balancing**
  * **Can sync** from MySQL/PostgreSQL/ODBC/xml/csv out of the box
  * Not fully ACID-compliant, but **supports transactions and binlog** for safe writes

  One of the highlights is a state-of-the-art scheduler using column generation, which significantly outperforms all other optimizers at [schedulingbenchmarks.org](http://www.schedulingbenchmarks.org/). **Try it in the browser (wasm) [here](https://www.strandmark.net/wasm/shift_scheduling_colgen_page.html)!**
  
  Implements the algorithm described in [_First-order Linear Programming in a Column Generation-Based Heuristic Approach to the Nurse Rostering Problem_](https://www.strandmark.net/papers/first-order-scheduling.pdf) (2020) [doi link](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cor.2020.104945).
  
  The `minimum::linear::colgen` module contains code for solving scheduling problems. It significantly outperforms all other optimizers at [schedulingbenchmarks.org](http://www.schedulingbenchmarks.org/).
  
  Some of the reasons it is fast:
  
  - It uses a first-order LP solver based on papers by Chambolle and Pock.
  - The pricing problem uses highly optimized dynamic programming in a DAG (in `minimum::algorithms`).
  - The [Ryan-Foster rule](https://strandmark.wordpress.com/2018/01/24/visualizing-the-ryan-foster-rule/) is used to iteratively work towards an integer solution. There is no time to branch and bound for big problems.

A Morton filter is a modified cuckoo filter that is optimized for bandwidth-constrained systems. Morton filters use additional computation in order to reduce their off-chip memory traffic. Like a cuckoo filter, a Morton filter supports insertions, deletions, and lookup operations. It additionally adds high-throughput self-resizing, a feature of quotient filters, which allows a Morton filter to increase its capacity solely by leveraging its internal representation. This capability is in contrast to existing vanilla cuckoo filter implementations, which are static and thus require using a backing data structure that contains the full set of items to resize the filter. Morton filters can also be configured to use less memory than a cuckoo filter for the same error rate while simultaneously delivering insertion, deletion, and lookup throughputs that are, respectively, up to 15.5x, 1.3x, and 2.5x higher than a cuckoo filter. Morton filters in contrast to vanilla cuckoo filters do not require a power of two number of buckets but rather only a number that is a multiple of two. They also use fewer bits per item than a Bloom filter when the target false positive rate is less than around 1% to 3%.

  In the offline phase of the algorithm MRPT indexes the data with a collection of *random projection trees*. In the online phase the index structure allows us to answer queries in superior time. A detailed description of the algorithm with the time and space complexities, and the aforementioned comparisons can be found in [our article](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ttonteri/pub/bigdata2016.pdf) that was published in IEEE International Conference on Big Data 2016.

- **nodesoup** [📁](./nodesoup) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/nodesoup) -- delivers graph untangling: a force-directed graph layout simulates forces to give motion to vertices and arrange them in a way that is visually pleasing and/or reveals structure. The Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm assigns a repelling force to vertices pair of the graph, effectively pushing apart vertices so they don't overlap, and a attraction force between each adjacent vertices pair, thus dragging closer connected vertices. The forces attenuate when the vertices get respectively further apart or closer, and a global temperature also serves as a simulated annealing, capping the maximum vertex displacement at each iteration. As the forces between each component and the temperature gradually diminish, the layout stabilizes.  Another method, the Kamada Kawai algorithm, relies on the simulation of springs between each vertex, which strength is determined by the length of the shortest path between both vertices. The potential energy of each vertex, i.e. the sum of the energy of all its springs, is then computed. The goal being to reduce the global energy of the layout, each vertex is moved step-by-step until its potential energy is considered low-enough, using a Newton-Raphson algorithm.

- **nsync** [📁](./nsync) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/nsync) -- a C library that exports various synchronization primitives. `nsync` may be desirable in place of `pthread` primitives in some cases:  (1) nsync locks are reader-writer locks (but are as efficient as mutexes).  (2) nsync locks and condition variables occupy only two words each.  (3) nsync works on Unix-like systems and Windows.  It should be portable to other platforms straightforwardly.  (4) nsync provides conditional critical sections.  These fill the same role as condition variables, but are usually easier to use, and in most common cases are comparable in speed.  They can be easier to use in two ways:  (A) it's not necessary to surround the "wait" operation in a while loop; instead the condition is passed to the call as a function and arbitrary pointer argument.  (B) it's not necessary to wake or signal explicitly when the condition(s) become true; they are checked automatically. The primary downsides are:  (A) they are not available in most other common synchronization APIs, and so they may be unfamiliar (even though they date back to the 1960s), and (B) if threads routinely wait on many distinct, false conditions associated with the same lock, they may be slower than condition variables. In this case, clients can use condition variables in the normal way; conditional critical sections and condition variables can be used with the same lock.  (5) nsync waits can be cancelled via an object passed to the wait calls, unlike the pthread model in which threads are cancelled.  This difference can be useful if the computation needs multiple threads, or if cancellation affects only sub-operations within a larger operation by the thread.

Finite-state acceptors are used to represent sets of strings (specifically, regular or rational sets); finite-state transducers are used to represent binary relations between pairs of strings (specifically, rational transductions). The weights can be used to represent the cost of taking a particular transition. FSTs have key applications in speech recognition and synthesis, machine translation, optical character recognition, pattern matching, string processing, machine learning, information extraction and retrieval among others. Often a weighted transducer is used to represent a probabilistic model (e.g., an n-gram model, pronunciation model). FSTs can be optimized by determinization and minimization, models can be applied to hypothesis sets (also represented as automata) or cascaded by finite-state composition, and the best results can be selected by shortest-path algorithms.

While POSIX condition variables (pthread_cond_t) and WIN32 events both provide the essential building blocks of the synchronization primitives required to write multithreaded code with signaling, the nature of the differences between the two have lent their way towards creating different synchronization and multithreaded-programming paradigms. The only features not included are only named events and support for security attributes. To the author's best knowledge, this is the only implementation of WIN32 events available for Linux and other posix platforms that provides support for simultaneously waiting on multiple events.

If a user then uploads the same video to YouTube, the hash will be almost identical, and it can be flagged as a possible copyright violation. The audio hash could be used to automatically tag MP3 files with proper ID3 information, while the text hash could be used for plagiarism detection.

- **PruningRadixTrie** [📁](./PruningRadixTrie) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/PruningRadixTrie) -- a 1000x faster Radix trie for prefix search & auto-complete, the PruningRadixTrie is a novel data structure, derived from a radix trie - but 3 orders of magnitude faster. A **Pruning Radix trie** is a novel Radix trie algorithm, that allows pruning of the Radix trie and early termination of the lookup. In many cases, we are not interested in a complete set of all children for a given prefix, but only in the top-k most relevant terms. Especially for short prefixes, this results in a **massive reduction of lookup time** for the top-10 results. On the other hand, a complete result set of millions of suggestions wouldn't be helpful at all for autocompletion. The lookup acceleration is achieved by storing in each node the maximum rank of all its children. By comparing this maximum child rank with the lowest rank of the results retrieved so far, we can heavily prune the trie and do early termination of the lookup for non-promising branches with low child ranks.

In this paper, the DCT-based denoising is accelerated by using a randomized algorithm. The DCT is based on the fastest algorithm and is SIMD vectorized by using SSE. Some modifications improve denoising performance in term of PSNR. The code is 100x faster than the OpenCV's implementation (cv::xphoto::dctDenoising) for the paper. Optionally, we can use DHT (discrete Walsh–Hadamard transform) for fast computation instead of using DCT.

No string copies or duplications are done, and no virtual functions are used. The data tree is a flat index-based structure stored in a single array. Serialization happens only at your direct request, after parsing / before emitting. Internally, the data tree representation stores only string views and has no knowledge of types, but of course, every node can have a YAML type tag. `ryml` makes it easy and fast to read and modify the data tree.
- **rawspeed** [📁](./rawspeed) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/rawspeed) -- a library for decoding various images in RAW file format, while providing the fastest decoding speed possible. Supports the most common DSLR and similar class brands.

- **re2c** [📁](./re2c) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/re2c) -- a lexer generator for C/C++, Go and Rust. Its main goal is generating fast lexers: at least as fast as their reasonably optimized hand-coded counterparts. Instead of using traditional table-driven approach, re2c encodes the generated finite state automata directly in the form of conditional jumps and comparisons. The resulting programs are faster and often smaller than their table-driven analogues, and they are much easier to debug and understand. re2c applies quite a few optimizations in order to speed up and compress the generated code.  Another distinctive feature is its flexible interface: instead of assuming a fixed program template, re2c lets the programmer write most of the interface code and adapt the generated lexer to any particular environment.
- **ReactivePlusPlus** [📁](./ReactivePlusPlus) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/ReactivePlusPlus) -- a reactive programming library for C++20 language inspired by "official implementation" ([RxCpp](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxCpp)) and original idea ([ReactiveX](https://reactivex.io/)) that only depends on standard library and C++20 features (mostly on [concepts](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constraints)).

The library only provides basic reflection primitives and is not a full-fledged, heavy, implementation for https://wg21.link/P2996 which is a language proposal with many more features and capabilities.
- **reflect-cpp** [📁](./reflect-cpp) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/reflect-cpp) -- a C++-20 library for **fast serialization, deserialization and validation** using reflection, similar to [pydantic](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic) in Python, [serde](https://github.com/serde-rs) in Rust, [encoding](https://github.com/golang/go/tree/master/src/encoding) in Go or [aeson](https://github.com/haskell/aeson/tree/master) in Haskell. As the aforementioned libraries are among the most widely used in the respective languages, reflect-cpp fills an important gap in C++ development. It reduces boilerplate code and increases code safety.
- **RE-flex** [📁](./RE-flex) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/RE-flex) -- the regex-centric, fast lexical analyzer generator for C++ with full Unicode support. Faster than Flex. Accepts Flex specifications. Generates reusable source code that is easy to understand. Introduces indent/dedent anchors, lazy quantifiers, functions for lex/syntax error reporting and more. Seamlessly integrates with Bison and other parsers.
  
  The RE/flex matcher tracks line numbers, column numbers, and indentations, whereas Flex does not (option `noyylineno`) and neither do the other regex matchers (except PCRE2 and Boost.Regex when used with RE/flex).
  Tracking this information incurs some overhead. RE/flex also automatically decodes UTF-8/16/32 input and accepts `std::istream`, strings, and wide strings as input.
  
  RE/flex runs equally fast or slightly faster than the best times of Flex.

- **resumable-assert** [📁](./resumable-assert) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/resumable-assert) -- `assert` replacement to continue execution in debugger. In any large app, it sometimes happens that some asserts are failing in code you don't currently care about, and blocking the entire team from being able to run the app until the issue is fixed is not the best workflow. So we usually end up moving the execution marker past the assert line in IDE or debugger, or even comment the assert out, recompile and relaunch. With Resumable Assert, you can simply continue execution when an assertion fails in debugger, or even disable asserts that you are not interested in, so that those never bother you again.

The Robots Exclusion Protocol (REP) is a standard that enables website owners to control which URLs may be accessed by automated clients (i.e. crawlers) through a simple text file with a specific syntax. It's one of the basic building blocks of the internet as we know it and what allows search engines to operate. Because the REP was only a de-facto standard for the past 25 years, different implementers implement parsing of robots.txt slightly differently, leading to confusion. This project aims to fix that by releasing the parser that Google uses.
- **rollinghashcpp** [📁](./rollinghashcpp) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/rollinghashcpp) -- randomized rolling hash functions in C++.

It's aimed at games development but could be useful in any industry where turnaround times are a bottleneck. RCC++ is primarily designed to shorten iteration times in development - developers can build their project, run it, make changes during runtime and see the results almost immediately. If needed, shipping code can [disable runtime compilation](https://github.com/RuntimeCompiledCPlusPlus/RuntimeCompiledCPlusPlus/wiki/Disabling-runtime-compilation) in a number of ways. RCC++ is not intended as a method to allow end users of a shipped binary to compile modifications, though with some work it can be used this way.

- **sac** [📁](./sac) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/sac) -- a state-of-the-art lossless audio compression model. Lossless audio compression is a complex problem, because PCM data is highly non-stationary and uses high sample resolution (typically >=16bit). That's why classic context modelling suffers from context dilution problems. Sac employs a simple OLS-NLMS predictor per frame including bias correction. Prediction residuals are encoded using a sophisticated bitplane coder including SSE and various forms of probability estimations. Meta-parameters of the predictor are optimized via binary search (or [DDS](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2005WR004723)) on by-frame basis. This results in a highly asymmetric codec design. We throw a lot of muscles at the problem and archive only little gains - by practically predicting noise.
- **safeclib** [📁](./safeclib) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/safeclib) -- Safe C Library implements the secure C11 Annex K functions on top of most libc implementations, which are missing from them.

A variety of script engines are encapsulated on the bottom and a unified API is exposed on the top, so that the upper-layer caller can completely isolate the underlying engine implementation (back-end).
  
  ScriptX not only isolates several JavaScript engines (e.g. V8 and QuickJS), but can even isolate different scripting languages, so that the upper layer can seamlessly switch between scripting engine and scripting language without changing the code.

- **scws-chinese-word-segmentation** [📁](./scws-chinese-word-segmentation) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/scws) -- SCWS (Simple Chinese Word Segmentation) (i.e.: Simple Chinese Word Segmentation System). This is a mechanical Chinese word segmentation engine based on word frequency dictionary, which can basically correctly segment a whole paragraph of Chinese text into words. A word is the smallest morpheme unit in Chinese, but when writing, it does not separate words with spaces like English, so how to segment words accurately and quickly has always been a difficult problem in Chinese word segmentation. SCWS supports Chinese encoding includes `GBK`, `UTF-8`, etc.
  
  There are not many innovative elements in the word segmentation algorithm. It uses a word frequency dictionary collected by itself, supplemented by certain proper names, names of people, and place names. Basic word segmentation is achieved by identifying rules such as digital age. After small-scale testing, the accuracy is between 90% and 95%, which can basically satisfy some use in small search engines, keyword extraction and other occasions. The first prototype version was released in late 2005.

- **semimap** [📁](./semimap) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/semimap) -- semi::static_map and semi::map: associative map containers with compile-time lookup! Normally, associative containers require some runtime overhead when looking up their values from a key. However, when the key is known at compile-time (for example, when the key is a literal) then this run-time lookup could technically be avoided. This is exactly what the goal of `semi::static_map` and `semi::map` is.

The Sherwood library comprises a general purpose, object-oriented software framework for applying decision forests to a wide range of inference problems.
- **Shifted-Hamming-Distance** [📁](./Shifted-Hamming-Distance) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/Shifted-Hamming-Distance) -- Shifted Hamming Distance (SHD) is an edit-distance based filter that can quickly check whether the minimum number of edits (including insertions, deletions and substitutions) between two strings is smaller than a user defined threshold **T** (the number of allowed edits between the two strings).  Testing if two stings differs by a small amount is a prevalent function that is used in many applications. One of its biggest usage, perhaps, is in DNA or protein mapping, where a short DNA or protein string is compared against an enormous database, in order to find similar matches. In such applications, a query string is usually compared against multiple candidate strings in the database. Only candidates that are similar to the query are considered **matches** and recorded.  SHD expands the basic Hamming distance computation, which only detects substitutions, into a full-fledged edit-distance filter, which counts not only substitutions but **insertions and deletions** as well.
- **shmdata** [📁](./shmdata) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/shmdata) -- shares streams of framed data between processes (1 writer to many readers) via shared memory. It supports any kind of data stream:  it has been used with multichannel audio, video frames, 3D models, OSC messages, and various others types of data. Shmdata is very fast and allows processes to access data streams without the need for extra copies.

- **Signals** [📁](./Signals) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/Signals) -- a lightweight "signals and slots" implementation using fast delegates. When GUI programming in C++, delegates and the signals and slots paradigm can vastly simplify your code. It implements the Observer pattern while avoiding all the boilerplate code. I needed a lightweight and efficient implementation that I could just drop into my projects and use without adding weird macros, inheriting from crazy templates or having external dependencies. I wanted something simpler and more efficient than libsigc++, sigslot, and boost.signals.
- **signal-slot-benchmarks** [📁](./signal-slot-benchmarks) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/signal-slot-benchmarks) -- comprehensive benchmarks for a majority of GitHub c++ signal slot implementations and others. These benchmarks do not accurately depict real world usage patterns seen in the wild. However, these benchmarks were designed to provide impartial results regardless of implementation.
- **signals-rt** [📁](./signals-rt) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/signals-rt) -- this Signal-Slot library is optimized for video games (and probably other low-latency applications as well). Interestingly, even though the observer pattern is generally useful, it has never been standardized in C++, which leads to the never-ending attempts at improvements by curious people. Many signal-slot libraries do not focus on performance, e.g. `boost::signals2` [invocation can be 90x more expensive than a simple function call](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22416860/is-boostsignals2-overkill-for-simple-applications). This work is based on previous [research](https://github.com/TheWisp/ImpossiblyFastEventCPP17) which focused on the syntax and performance improvements brought by a C++17 feature - `template<auto>`. This library is a combination of modern C++ exploration, system programming and data-structure design. It aims to become feature-complete like `boost::signals`, yet extremely light-weight - both run time and memory footprint - in order to replace _interface_ or `std::function` based callbacks. `signal` emission is **faster** than virtual function calls. Compared to virtual calls, `signal` calls only take between 22% and 77% of the time, depending on the number and the level of randomness of classes and objects.
- **sigslot** [📁](./sigslot) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/sigslot) -- a header-only, thread safe implementation of signal-slots for C++. The main goal was to replace Boost.Signals2.

- **simdcomp** [📁](./simdcomp) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/simdcomp) -- SIMDComp is a simple C library for compressing lists of integers using binary packing and SIMD instructions. The assumption is either that you have a list of 32-bit integers where most of them are small, or a list of 32-bit integers where differences between successive integers are small. No software is able to reliably compress an array of 32-bit random numbers.
- **simde** [📁](./simde) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/simde) -- SIMD Everywhere: the SIMDe header-only library provides fast, portable implementations of [SIMD intrinsics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD) on hardware which doesn't natively support them, such as calling [SSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions) functions on ARM.  There is no performance penalty if the hardware supports the native implementation (*e.g.*, SSE/[AVX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions) runs at full speed on [x86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86), [NEON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture#Advanced_SIMD_(Neon)) on [ARM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture), *etc.*).

- **SIMDString** [📁](./SIMDString) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/SIMDString) -- a [MIT-licensed](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) open source implementation of a fast C++ string class designed for use in games. It is a drop-in replacement for `std::string` that is 10-100x faster for many common operations, such as small `string::operator+=(const char*)`, `string::string(const string&)`, `string::string(const char*)`, and `string::c_str()`.
- **simdutf** [📁](./simdutf) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/simdutf) -- delivers Unicode validation and transcoding at billions of characters per second, providing fast Unicode functions such as ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-16LE/BE and UTF-32 validation, with and without error identification, Latin1 to UTF-8 transcoding and vice versa, etc.  The functions are accelerated using SIMD instructions (e.g., ARM NEON, SSE, AVX, AVX-512, RISC-V Vector Extension, etc.). When your strings contain hundreds of characters, we can often transcode them at speeds exceeding a billion characters per second. You should expect high speeds not only with English strings (ASCII) but also Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, and so forth. We handle the full character range (including, for example, emojis).
- **simhash-cpp** [📁](./simhash-cpp) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/simhash-cpp) -- Simhash Near-Duplicate Detection enables the identification of all fingerprints that are nearly identical to a query fingerprint. In this context, a fingerprint is an unsigned 64-bit integer. It also comes with an auxillary function designed to generate a fingerprint given a `char*` and a length. This fingeprint is generated with a tokenizer and a hash function (both of which may be provided as template parameters). Using a cyclic hash function, it then performs simhash on a moving window of tokens (as defined by the tokenizer).
- **sioyek** [📁](./sioyek) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/sioyek) -- a PDF viewer with a focus on textbooks and research papers.
- **SipHash** [📁](./SipHash) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/SipHash) -- SipHash is a family of pseudorandom functions (PRFs) optimized for speed on short messages. This is the reference C code of SipHash: portable, simple, optimized for clarity and debugging. SipHash was designed in 2012 by [Jean-Philippe Aumasson](https://aumasson.jp) and [Daniel J. Bernstein](https://cr.yp.to) as a defense against [hash-flooding DoS attacks](https://aumasson.jp/siphash/siphashdos_29c3_slides.pdf).
  
  It is *simpler and faster* on short messages than previous cryptographic algorithms, such as MACs based on universal hashing, *competitive in performance* with insecure non-cryptographic algorithms, such as [fhhash](https://github.com/cbreeden/fxhash), *cryptographically secure*, with no sign of weakness despite multiple [cryptanalysis](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/865) [projects](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/865) by leading cryptographers, *battle-tested*, with successful integration in OSs (Linux kernel, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, FreeRTOS), languages (Perl, Python, Ruby, etc.), libraries (OpenSSL libcrypto, Sodium, etc.) and applications (Wireguard, Redis, etc.).
  
  As a secure pseudorandom function (a.k.a. keyed hash function), SipHash can also be used as a secure message authentication code (MAC). But SipHash is *not a hash* in the sense of general-purpose key-less hash function such as BLAKE3 or SHA-3. SipHash should therefore always be used with a secret key in order to be secure.

- **siridb-server** [📁](./siridb-server) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/siridb-server) -- SiriDB Server is a highly-scalable, robust and super fast time series database.

Upon insertion, a key is returned that can be used to later access or remove the values. Insertion, removal, and access are all guaranteed to take `O(1)` time (best, worst, and average case). Great for storing collections of objects that need stable, safe references but have no clear ownership. The difference between a `std::unordered_map` and a `dod::slot_map` is that the slot map generates and returns the key when inserting a value. A key is always unique and will only refer to the value that was inserted.

It does not aim for maximum compression, or compatibility with any other compression library; instead, it aims for very high speeds and reasonable compression.
  
  - **second-choice**; reason: see `lzo2` above. LZ4 either overtakes this one or is on par (anno 2022 AD) and I don't see a lot happening here, so the coolness factor is slowly fading.

- **SSIM** [📁](./SSIM) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/SSIM) -- the **structural similarity index measure** (**SSIM**) is a popular method to predict perceived image quality. Published in April 2004, with over [46,000 Google Scholar citations](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Image+quality+assessment:+from+error+visibility+to+structural+similarity&hl=en&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart), it has been re-implemented hundreds, perhaps thousands, of times, and is widely used as a measurement of image quality for image processing algorithms (even in places where it does not make sense, leading to even worse outcomes!).  Unfortunately, if you try to reproduce results in papers, or simply grab a few SSIM implementations and compare results, you will soon find that it is (nearly?) impossible to find two implementations that agree, and even harder to find one that agrees with the original from the author. Chris Lomont ran into this issue many times, so he finally decided to write it up once and for all (and provide clear code that matches the original results, hoping to help reverse the mess that is current SSIM). Most of the problems come from the original implementation being in MATLAB, which not everyone can use. Running the same code in open source Octave, which claims to be MATLAB compatible, even returns wrong results!  This large and inconsistent variation among SSIM implementations makes it hard to trust or compare published numbers between papers. The original paper doesn't define how to handle color images, doesn't specify what color space the grayscale values represent (linear? gamma compressed?), adding to the inconsistencies and results. The lack of color causes the following images to be rated as visually perfect by SSIM as published. The paper demonstrates so many issues when using SSIM with color images that they state "**we advise not to use SSIM with color images**".  All of this is a shame since the underlying concept works well for the given compute complexity. A good first step to cleaning up this mess is trying to get widely used implementations to match the author results for their published test values, and this requires clearly specifying the algorithm at the computational level, which the authors did not. Chris Lomont explains some of these choices, and most importantly, provides original, MIT licensed, single file C++ header and single file C# implementations; each reproduces the original author code better than any other version I have found.

- **tscns** [📁](./tscns) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/tscns) -- What's the problem with clock_gettime/gettimeofday/std::chrono::XXX_clock? Although current Linux systems are using VDSO to implement clock_gettime/gettimeofday/std::chrono::XXX_clock, they still have a nonnegligible overhead with latency from 20 to 100 ns. The problem is even worse on Windows as the latency is more unstable and could be as high as 1 us. Also on Windows, the high resolution clock is at only 100 ns precision. These problems are not good for time-critical tasks where high precison timestamp is required and latency of getting timestamp itself should be minimized.  TSCNS uses `rdtsc` instruction and simple arithmetic operations to implement a thread-safe clock with 1 ns precision, and is much faster and stable in terms of latency at less than 10 ns, comprising latency of `rdtsc` (4 ~ 7 ns depending on platforms) plus calculations in less than 1 ns.  TSCNS can be closely synchronized with the system clock, which makes it a good alternative of standard system clocks. However, real-time synchronization requires the clock to be calibrated at a proper interval, but it's a easy and cheap job to do.

- **uni-algo** [📁](./uni-algo) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/uni-algo) -- this library handles all unicode conversion/processing problems (there are not only ill-formed sequences actually) properly and always according to The Unicode Standard: in C/C++ there is no safe type for UTF-8/UTF-16 that guarantees that the data will be well-formed; this makes the problem even worse. There are plenty of Unicode libraries for C/C++ out there that implement Unicode algorithms of varying quality, but many of them don't handle ill-formed UTF sequences at all. In the best-case scenario, you'll get an exception/error; in the worst-case, undefined behavior. The biggest problem is that in 99% cases everything will be fine. This is inappropriate for security reasons. This library doesn't work with types/strings/files/streams, it works with the data inside them and makes it safe when it's needed. Check this article if you want more information about ill-formed sequences: https://hsivonen.fi/broken-utf-8 . It is a bit outdated because ICU (International Components for Unicode) now uses W3C conformant implementation too, but the information in the article is very useful. This library does use W3C conformant implementation.

- **unsmear** [📁](./unsmear) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/unsmear) -- converts precisely between timestamps in the timescale of [UTC with smeared leap seconds](https://developers.google.com/time/smear) and the unsmeared [TAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Time) and GPS timescales. This allows smeared time to be stored and distributed exclusively, then converted to and from other timescales in applications where the smear's 11.6 ppm frequency change is consequential. No parallel time distribution systems are required, nor is any mechanism necessary for a system to record what timescale its system clock is using. In other words, the smear is not a way of approximately smudging the clock; it is a defined, precise, and reversible conversion. Rather than having seconds of constant length and minutes with a variable number of seconds, there are always 60 seconds in a minute and the length of a second sometimes differs from those of TAI.

Lots of protocols between different services use it, databases store JSON (document stores naturally, but others increasingly as well). It is popular, because it is simple, human-readable, and yet surprisingly versatile, despite its limitations. At the same time there is a plethora of alternatives ranging from XML over Universal Binary JSON, MongoDB's BSON, MessagePack, BJSON (binary JSON), Apache Thrift till Google's protocol buffers and ArangoDB's shaped JSON. When looking into this, we were surprised to find that none of these formats manages to combine compactness, platform independence, fast access to sub-objects and rapid conversion from and to JSON.

So why use it then? What makes xmunch different from the other tools is the ability to extend incomplete word-lists. For hunspell's munch to identify a stem and add an affix mark, every word formed by the affix with the stem has to be in the original word-list. This makes sense for a compression tool. However if your word list is incomplete, you have to add all possible word-forms of a word first, before any compression is done. Using xmunch instead, you can define a subset of forms which are required to be in the word-list to allow the word to be used as stem. Like this, you can extend the word-list.

Modest resource requirements and simplicity make XOR [scapegoat trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapegoat_tree) stand out of the [BST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree) crowd. All iterators (except `end()` iterators), but not references and pointers, are invalidated, after inserting or erasing from this XOR [scapegoat tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapegoat_tree) implementation. You can dereference invalidated iterators, if they were not erased, but you cannot iterate with them. `end()` iterators are constant and always valid, but dereferencing them results in undefined behavior.

Moreover, it allows batch updating the citations, as they may change over time.
  
  **When updating multiple citations in a batch, it may happen that citation queries are blocked by Google Scholar for multiple automated requests. If a blockage happens, the add-on opens a browser window and directs it to http://scholar.google.com/, where you should see a Captcha displayed by Google Scholar, which you need to enter to get unblocked and then re-try updating the citations. It may happen that Google Scholar displays a message like the following "*We're sorry... but your computer or network may be sending automated queries. To protect our users, we can't process your request right now.*" In that case, the only solution is to wait for a while until Google unblocks you.**

- **Imath** [🌐](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/Imath) -- float16 support lib for OpenEXR format
  
  - **optional**; reason: considered *overkill* for the projects I'm currently involved in, including Qiqqa. Those can use [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/), [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) or other thirdparty pipelines to convert to & from supported formats.

- **OpenImageIO** [🌐](https://github.com/OpenImageIO/oiio) -- a library for reading, writing, and processing images in a wide variety of file formats, using a format-agnostic API, aimed at VFX applications.
  
  - **tentative/pending**; reason: considered nice & cool but still *overkill*. Qiqqa tooling can use [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/), [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) or other thirdparty pipelines to convert to & from supported formats.

- ~~**circlehash** [📁](./circlehash) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/circlehash) -- a family of non-cryptographic hash functions that pass every test in SMHasher.~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: written in Go; port to C/C++ is easy but just too much effort for too little gain; when we're looking for *fast* non-cryptographic hashes like this, we don't appreciate it to include 128-bit / 64-bit multiplications as those are generally slower than shift, add, xor. While this will surely be a nice hash, it doesn't fit our purposes.

- ~~**cpuinfo** [📁](./cpuinfo) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/cpuinfo) -- CPU & hardware info~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: Linux-only, non-portable, deemed unsuitable for our needs.

  - **removed**; reason: we've decided on using `crow` as the main server framework. Second choice is `civetweb`. As we're looking for a non-public-facing web server, we don't need h2o and it's complexity.

- ~~**libjxl** [📁](./libjxl) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/libjxl) -- JPEG XL reference implementation~~
  
  **NOTICE**: due to historical reasons on my side, this code is tracked at https://github.com/GerHobbelt/jpeg-xl: see there for future track/update work of the JPEG-XL library.

- ~~**merror** [📁](./merror) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/merror) -- a library for error handling in C++ without exceptions.~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: code is non-portable to compilers other than GCC, or at least would require more effort than we're willing to expend on this.

- ~~**qoir** [📁](./qoir) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/qoir) -- QOIR (pronounced like "choir") is a simple, lossless image file format that is very fast to encode and decode while achieving compression ratios roughly comparable to PNG. It was inspired by the [QOI image file format](https://qoiformat.org/),~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: code does not compile and depends on outdated jpegXL internal source code, which does not exist any more in the latest revisions, while work on this repo has stopped a few years ago.

- ~~**binary_bakery** [🌐](https://github.com/s9w/binary_bakery) -- resource compiler-like tool: embed any data in your C/C++ application~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: we already have `bin2coff` from MuPDF, which serves this purpose well enough.

- ~~**Catch2** [🌐](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: we've decided to standardize on a single unittest library (which is well supported in Microsoft Visual Studio, including the Test Explorer view there); where necessary, we'll have to provide a translation layer instead when existing submodules use different test rigs originally.

- ~~**cgohlke::imagecodecs** [🌐](https://github.com/cgohlke/imagecodecs) (*not included; see also DICOM slot above*)~~
- ~~**clippson** [🌐](https://github.com/heavywatal/clippson) -- commandline parser + JSON data diagnostical dumper~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: deemed cool but unsuitable for our needs. Besides, we intend to use `cli11` instead of `clipp` for that library is easier to read and support is more active there.

- ~~**cpu_features** [🌐](https://github.com/google/cpu_features)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: Linux-only, non-portable, deemed unsuitable for our needs.

- ~~**cpu_stat** [🌐](https://github.com/vivaladav/cpu-stat)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: Linux-only, non-portable, deemed unsuitable for our needs.

- ~~**CPython** [🌐](https://github.com/python/cpython)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: we've decided to offer any application user facing scripting features in JavaScript only: Python and the others can use socket-based messaging when someone wants to write their user scripts in any of those languages.

- ~~[DICOM to NIfTI](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix) (*not included; see also DICOM slot above*)~~
- ~~**EasyLogger** [🌐](https://github.com/armink/EasyLogger) -- an ultra-lightweight (ROM<1.6K, RAM<0.3K), high-performance C/C++ log library, very suitable for resource-sensitive software projects. Compared with the well-known C/C++ log libraries such as log4c and zlog, EasyLogger has simpler functions and provides fewer interfaces to users, but it will be quick to get started. More practical functions support dynamic expansion in the form of plug-ins.~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: we've decided on using `glog` as the logging library for everything: while that one isn't perfect, most of the other stuff we've been looking at is using that one already and it matches our needs 80% of the time, while I'm okay with patching that library for the other 20% (syslog-like use, i.e. logging to localhost logging server where all logging is collected -- these log messages should travel across as part of the ZeroMQ message streams.)

- ~~**FastBinaryEncoding** [🌐](https://github.com/chronoxor/FastBinaryEncoding)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: for binary format record serialization we will be using `bebop` exclusively. All other communications will be JSON/JSON5/XML based.

- ~~**flatbuffers** [🌐](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: see `protobuf`: same smell rising. Faster at run time, but still a bit hairy to my tastes while `bebop` et al are on to something *potentially nice*.

- ~~**flatcc** [🌐](https://github.com/dvidelabs/flatcc)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: see `flatbuffers`. When we don't dig `flatbuffers`, then `flatcc` is automatically pretty useless to us. Let's rephrase that professionally: "`flatcc` has moved out of scope for our project."

- ~~**GDCM-Grassroots-DICOM** [🌐](https://github.com/malaterre/GDCM)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: not a frequently used format; the filter codes can be found in other libraries. *Overkill*. Qiqqa tooling can use [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/), [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) or other thirdparty pipelines to convert to & from supported formats.

- ~~**gmime** [🌐](https://github.com/jstedfast/gmime) (alternative repo [here](https://github.com/GNOME/gmime)) -- multipart MIME library; serves as a fundamental building block for full MHTML file format I/O support~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: GNOME libraries are horrible to integrate with other codebases.

- ~~**HDF5** [🌐](https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf5)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: HDF5 is a nice concept but considered *overkill* right now; where we need disk stores, we'll be using SQLite or LMDB-like key-value stores instead. Such stores are not meant to be interchangeable with other software in their raw shape and we'll provide public access APIs instead, where applicable.

- ~~**HighFive-HDF5** [🌐](https://github.com/BlueBrain/HighFive)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: see the `HDF5` entry above.

- ~~**ice** [🌐](https://github.com/zeroc-ice/ice) -- Comprehensive RPC Framework: helps you network your software with minimal effort.~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: has a strong focus on the *remote*, i.e. `R` in `RPC` (thus a focus on things such as encryption, authentication, firewalling, etc.), which we don't want or need: all services are supposed to run on a single machine and comms go through `localhost` *only*. When folks find they need to distribute the workload across multiple machines, then we'll be entering a new era in Qiqqa usage and then will be soon enough to (re-)investigate the usefulness of this package.

- ~~**iniparser** [🌐](https://github.com/ndevilla/iniparser)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: we've decided on using `libconfig` for configuration files.

- ~~**libmicrohttpd** [🌐](https://github.com/Karlson2k/libmicrohttpd)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: we've decided on using `crow` as the main server framework. Second choices are `civetweb` and `h2o`. This GNU library is way too 'Unix-is-the-world' oriented for a smooth portable dev experience.

- ~~**log4cplus** [🌐](https://github.com/log4cplus/log4cplus)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: we've decided on using `glog`/`spdlog` as the logging library for everything. `log4cplus`, at the same time, is a tad too much. (I consider `log4j` et al *overdone* as it caters to every need instead of just providing those things as contrib code which can be integrated at need -- should not be as far run-time configurable as it currently is.)

- ~~**lua** [🌐](https://github.com/lua/lua)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: we've decided to offer any application user facing scripting features in JavaScript only: Python and the others can use socket-based messaging when someone wants to write their user scripts in any of those languages. See also the `CPython` entry.

- ~~**luaJIT** [🌐](https://github.com/LuaJIT/LuaJIT)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: see the `lua` entry above.

- ~~**lzo** [🌐](https://github.com/nemequ/lzo)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: gone as part of the first round of compression libraries' cleanup: we intend to support lz4 for fast work, plus zstd and *maybe* brotli for higher compression ratios, while we won't bother with anything else: the rest can be dealt with through [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/) or other thirdparty pipelines when we need to read (or write) them. See also: [7zip-Zstd](https://github.com/mcmilk/7-Zip-zstd), which is what I use for accessing almost all compressed material anywhere.

- ~~**lzsse** [🌐](https://github.com/ConorStokes/LZSSE)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: see `lzo` above. LZ4 either overtakes this one or is on par (anno 2022 AD) and I don't see a lot happening here, so the coolness factor is slowly fading...

- ~~**oatpp** [🌐](https://github.com/oatpp/oatpp) -- IPC / server framework~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: see `crow`. We have picked `crow` as the preferred way forward, so any similar/competing product is out of scope unless `crow` throws a tantrum on our test bench after all, the chances of that being *very slim*.

- ~~**pithy** [🌐](https://github.com/johnezang/pithy)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: see `lzo` above. LZ4 either overtakes this one or is on par (anno 2022 AD) and I don't see a lot happening here, so the coolness factor is slowly fading...

- ~~**xz-utils** [🌐](https://github.com/xz-mirror/xz)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: see `lzo2` above. When we want this, we can go through [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/) or other thirdparty pipelines.

- ~~**zlog** [🌐](https://github.com/HardySimpson/zlog)~~
  
  - **removed**; `zlog` has a nice overall design but is too 'Unix-is-the-world' in its coding: in the end it was ease of cross-platform compilation of `glog`/`spdlog` that won the day and I'm okay with layering on top of that one to get the zlog category and other channel features, once I really need them.
