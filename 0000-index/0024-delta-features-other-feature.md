### _delta features_ & other feature extraction (see Qiqqa research notes)

- **diffutils** [📁](./diffutils) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/diffutils) -- the GNU diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp utilities. Their features are a superset of the Unix features and they are significantly faster.
- **dtl-diff-template-library** [📁](./dtl-diff-template-library) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/dtl) -- `dtl` is the diff template library written in C++.
- **google-diff-match-patch** [📁](./google-diff-match-patch) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/diff-match-patch) -- Diff, Match and Patch offers robust algorithms to perform the operations required for synchronizing plain text.
  
  1. Diff:
     * Compare two blocks of plain text and efficiently return a list of differences.
  2. Match:
     * Given a search string, find its best fuzzy match in a block of plain text. Weighted for both accuracy and location.
  3. Patch:
     * Apply a list of patches onto plain text. Use best-effort to apply patch even when the underlying text doesn't match.

- **HDiffPatch** [📁](./HDiffPatch) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/HDiffPatch) -- a library and command-line tools for Diff & Patch between binary files or directories(folders); cross-platform; runs fast; create small delta/differential; support large files and limit memory requires when diff & patch.
- **libdist** [📁](./libdist) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/distlib) -- string distance related functions (Damerau-Levenshtein, Jaro-Winkler, longest common substring & subsequence) implemented as SQLite run-time loadable extension, with UTF-8 support.
- **libharry** [📁](./libharry) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/harry) -- Harry - A Tool for Measuring String Similarity. The tool supports several common distance and kernel functions for strings as well as some excotic similarity measures.  The focus of Harry lies on implicit similarity measures, that is, comparison functions that do not give rise to an explicit vector space.  Examples of such similarity measures are the Levenshtein distance, the Jaro-Winkler distance or the spectrum kernel.
- **open-vcdiff** [📁](./open-vcdiff) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/open-vcdiff) -- an encoder and decoder for the VCDIFF format, as described in [RFC 3284](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3284.txt): The VCDIFF Generic Differencing and Compression Data Format.
- **rollinghashcpp** [📁](./rollinghashcpp) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/rollinghashcpp) -- randomized rolling hash functions in C++. This is a set of C++ classes implementing various recursive n-gram hashing techniques, also called rolling hashing (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_hash), including Randomized Karp-Rabin (sometimes called Rabin-Karp), Hashing by Cyclic Polynomials (also known as Buzhash) and Hashing by Irreducible Polynomials.
- **ssdeep** [📁](./ssdeep) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/ssdeep) -- fuzzy hashing library, can be used to assist with identifying almost identical files using context triggered piecewise hashing.
- **xdelta** [📁](./xdelta) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/xdelta) -- a C library and command-line tool for delta compression using VCDIFF/RFC 3284 streams.
- **yara-pattern-matcher** [📁](./yara-pattern-matcher) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/yara) -- for automated and user-specified pattern recognition in custom document & metadata *cleaning* / processing tasks
