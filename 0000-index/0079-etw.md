### ETW (Event Tracing for Microsoft Windows)

- **EtwExplorer** [📁](./EtwExplorer) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/EtwExplorer) -- View ETW Provider metadata. Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) is a logging facility built into the Windows OS. Modern providers register a manifest that describes all the events they support, with their properties. Classic providers register a MOF instead.
- **krabsETW** [📁](./krabsETW) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/krabsetw) -- a C++ library that simplifies interacting with ETW. It allows for any number of traces and providers to be enabled and for client code to register for event notifications from these traces.
- **libevt** [📁](./libevt) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/libevt) -- a library to access the Windows Event Log (EVT) format.
- **Sealighter** [📁](./Sealighter) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/Sealighter) -- Sysmon-Like research tool for ETW: helps non-developers dive into researching Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) and Windows PreProcessor Tracing (WPP).
- **SilkETW** [📁](./SilkETW) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/SilkETW) -- SilkETW & SilkService are flexible C# wrappers for ETW, they are meant to abstract away the complexities of ETW and give people a simple interface to perform research and introspection. While both projects have obvious defensive (and offensive) applications they should primarily be considered as research tools.
- **tracelogging-for-ETW** [📁](./tracelogging-for-ETW) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/tracelogging) -- C++ Wrapper for Windows ETW TraceLogging
- **UIforETW** [📁](./UIforETW) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/UIforETW) -- Bruce Dawson's user interface for recording ETW (Event Tracing for Windows) traces, which allow amazingly deep investigations of performance problems on Windows.
- **Windows10EtwEvents** [📁](./Windows10EtwEvents) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/Windows10EtwEvents) -- Events from all manifest-based and mof-based ETW providers across Windows 10 versions.
