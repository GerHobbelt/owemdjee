### Ruby*ism*

- **mruby** [📁](./mruby) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/mruby) -- the lightweight implementation of the Ruby language complying to (part of) the ISO standard with more recent features provided by Ruby 3.x. Also, its syntax is Ruby 3.x compatible except for pattern matching.  You can link and embed mruby within your application. The "mruby" interpreter program and the interactive "mirb" shell are provided as examples. You can also compile Ruby programs into compiled byte code using the "mrbc" compiler.
- **mrubyc** [📁](./mrubyc) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/mrubyc) -- mruby/c is another implementation of mruby, featuring small memory consumption, limited class libraries and emphasizing small size rather than execution speed.
- **pocketlang** [📁](./pocketlang) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/pocketlang) -- a lightweight (~3000 semicolons) and [fast](https://github.com/ThakeeNathees/pocketlang#performance) object oriented, embeddable scripting language written in C. It has a ruby flavoured python syntax, that can be learned [within 15 minutes](https://thakeenathees.github.io/pocketlang/docs/v0.1.0/Reference/Cheat-Sheet.html). Including the compiler, bytecode VM and runtime, it's a standalone executable with zero external dependencies just as it's self descriptive name. The pocketlang VM can be embedded in another hosting program very easily.
