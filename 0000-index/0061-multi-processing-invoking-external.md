### multi-processing: invoking external applications

- **cpplocate** [📁](./cpplocate) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/cpplocate) -- a cross-platform C++ library that provides tools for applications to locate their binary files and data assets, as well as those of dependent modules.
- **cr** [📁](./cr) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/cr) -- a single file header-only live reload solution for C, written in C++: simple public API, 3 functions to use only (and another to export); works and tested on Linux, MacOSX and Windows; based on dynamic reloadable binary (.so/.dylib/.dll).
- **createprocess-windows** [📁](./createprocess-windows) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/createprocess-windows) -- drive `CreateProcess` Win32 API
- **dlfcn-win32** [📁](./dlfcn-win32) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/dlfcn-win32) -- an implementation of `dlfcn` for Windows. `dlfcn` is a set of functions that allows runtime dynamic library loading. It is standardized in the POSIX. Windows also provide similar routines, but not in a POSIX-compatible way. This library attempts to implement a wrapper around the Windows functions to make programs written for POSIX that use dlfcn work in Windows without any modifications.
- **PlatformFolders** [📁](./PlatformFolders) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/PlatformFolders) -- a C++ library to look for directories like `My Documents`, `~/.config`, `%APPDATA%`, etc. so that you do not need to write platform-specific code.
- **reproc** [📁](./reproc) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/reproc) -- reproc (Redirected Process) is a cross-platform C/C++ library that simplifies starting, stopping and communicating with external programs. The main use case is executing command line applications directly from C or C++ code and retrieving their output.
- **subprocess** [📁](./subprocess) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/subprocess) -- cross platform subprocess library for C++ similar to design of Python `subprocess`.
- **subprocess-cpp** [📁](./subprocess-cpp) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/subprocess-cpp) -- a no nonsense library for writing shell commands in C++.
- **tiny-process-library** [📁](./tiny-process-library) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/tiny-process-library) -- small platform independent library making it simple to create and stop new processes, as well as writing to stdin and reading from stdout and stderr of a new process.
- https://github.com/arun11299/cpp-subprocess -- as close as possible to Python2.7 `subprocess` module in dealing with processes.
- https://github.com/pnappa/subprocesscpp -- A header-only library that allows you to execute processes either synchronously or asynchronously, whilst providing input and output handling. No more calling `exec` in C++!
- https://github.com/rajatjain1997/subprocess -- A C++ high level library for running shell processes
- https://github.com/sheredom/subprocess.h -- A one header solution to launching processes and interacting with them for C/C++.
