- **extract** [📁](../../thirdparty/extract) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/thirdparty_extract) -- clone of git://git.ghostscript.com/extract.git
- **farver-OKlab** [📁](./farver-OKlab) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/farver) -- provides very fast, vectorised functions for conversion of colours between different colour spaces, colour comparisons (distance between colours), encoding/decoding, and channel manipulation in colour strings.
- **freeglut** [📁](../../thirdparty/freeglut) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/thirdparty-freeglut) -- Freeglut, the Free OpenGL Utility Toolkit, is meant to be a free alternative to Mark Kilgard's GLUT library. In short, freeglut can be used by OpenGL programs to perform those tasks which would normally require platform-specific code. Tasks like creating a window, creating an OpenGL context and binding it to the window, and processing input events. Freeglut provides a concise and elegant API to handle those tasks, in a platform-independent manner, keeping the application simple and portable.
- **freetype** [📁](../../thirdparty/freetype) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/thirdparty-freetype2) -- FreeType is a freely available software library to render fonts.
- **graph-coloring** [📁](./graph-coloring) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/graph-coloring) -- a C++ Graph Coloring Package. This project has two primary uses:
  
  * As an executable for finding the chromatic number for an input graph (in edge list or edge matrix format)
  * As a library for finding the particular coloring of an input graph (represented as a `map<string,vector<string>>` edge list)

- **harfbuzz** [📁](../../thirdparty/harfbuzz) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/thirdparty-harfbuzz) -- a text shaping engine. It primarily supports [OpenType][1], but also [Apple Advanced Typography][2].
- **jbig2dec** [📁](../../thirdparty/jbig2dec) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/jbig2dec) -- a decoder library and example utility implementing the JBIG2 bi-level image compression spec. Also known as ITU T.88 and ISO IEC 14492, and included by reference in Adobe's PDF version 1.4 and later.
- **lcms2** [📁](../../thirdparty/lcms2) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/thirdparty-lcms2) -- `lcms2mt` is a thread-safe fork of `lcms` (a.k.a. Little CMS). Little CMS intends to be a small-footprint color management engine, with special focus on accuracy and performance. It uses the International Color Consortium standard (ICC), which is the modern standard when regarding to color management. The ICC specification is widely used and is referred to in many International and other de-facto standards. It was approved as an International Standard, ISO 15076-1, in 2005. Little CMS is a **full implementation** of ICC specification 4.3, it fully supports all kind of V2 and V4 profiles, including abstract, devicelink and named color profiles.
- **leptonica** [📁](../../thirdparty/leptonica) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/leptonica) -- supports many operations that are useful on images.
  
  Features:
  
  * Rasterop (aka bitblt)
  * Affine transforms (scaling, translation, rotation, shear) on images of arbitrary pixel depth
  * Projective and bilinear transforms
  * Binary and grayscale morphology, rank order filters, and convolution
  * Seedfill and connected components
  * Image transformations with changes in pixel depth, both at the same scale and with scale change
  * Pixelwise masking, blending, enhancement, arithmetic ops, etc.

- **libjpeg** [📁](../../thirdparty/libjpeg) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/thirdparty-libjpeg) -- the Independent JPEG Group's JPEG software
- **libpng** [📁](../../thirdparty/libpng) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/libpng) -- LIBPNG: Portable Network Graphics support, official libpng repository.
- **libtiff** [📁](../../thirdparty/libtiff) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/libtiff) -- TIFF Software Distribution
- **mozjpeg** [📁](./mozjpeg) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/mozjpeg) -- the Mozilla JPEG Encoder Project improves JPEG compression efficiency achieving higher visual quality and smaller file sizes at the same time. It is compatible with the JPEG standard, and the vast majority of the world's deployed JPEG decoders. MozJPEG is a patch for [libjpeg-turbo](https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo).
- **OpenColorIO** [📁](./OpenColorIO) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/OpenColorIO) -- OpenColorIO (OCIO) is a complete color management solution geared towards motion picture production with an emphasis on visual effects and computer animation. OCIO provides a straightforward and consistent user experience across all supporting applications while allowing for sophisticated back-end configuration options suitable for high-end production usage. OCIO is compatible with the Academy Color Encoding Specification (ACES) and is LUT-format agnostic, supporting many popular formats.
- **openjpeg** [📁](../../thirdparty/openjpeg) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/thirdparty-openjpeg) -- OPENJPEG Library and Applications -- OpenJPEG is an open-source JPEG 2000 codec written in C language. It has been developed in order to promote the use of [JPEG 2000](http://www.jpeg.org/jpeg2000), a still-image compression standard from the Joint Photographic Experts Group ([JPEG](http://www.jpeg.org)).  Since April 2015, it is officially recognized by ISO/IEC and ITU-T as a [JPEG 2000 Reference Software](http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.804-201504-I!Amd2).
- **PDFGen** [📁](./PDFGen) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/PDFGen) -- a simple PDF Creation/Generation library, contained in a single C-file with header and no external library dependencies. Useful for embedding into other programs that require rudimentary PDF output.
- **vivid** [📁](./vivid) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/vivid) -- vivid 🌈 is a simple-to-use C++ color library.
- **zlib** [📁](../../thirdparty/zlib) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/thirdparty-zlib) -- zlib-ng: zlib data compression library for the next generation systems.
