- **daScript** [📁](./daScript) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/daScript) -- Daslang - high-performance statically strong typed scripting language.
- **gravity** [📁](./gravity) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/gravity) -- a powerful, dynamically typed, lightweight, embeddable programming language written in C without any external dependencies (except for stdlib). It is a class-based concurrent scripting language with modern <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift">Swift</a>-like syntax. **Gravity** supports procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming, and data-driven programming. Thanks to special built-in methods, it can also be used as a prototype-based programming language.
- **picoc** [📁](./picoc) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/picoc) -- PicoC is a very small C interpreter for scripting. It was originally written as a script language for a UAV's on-board flight system. It's also very suitable for other robotic, embedded and non-embedded applications. The core C source code is around 3500 lines of code. It's not intended to be a complete implementation of ISO C but it has all the essentials.
