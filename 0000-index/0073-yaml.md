### YAML

- **libcyaml** [📁](./libcyaml) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/libcyaml) -- a C library for reading and writing structured YAML documents. The fundamental idea behind CYAML is to allow applications to construct schemas which describe both the permissible structure of the YAML documents to read/write, and the C data structure(s) in which the loaded data is arranged in memory.
- **libfyaml** [📁](./libfyaml) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/libfyaml) -- a fancy 1.2 YAML and JSON parser/writer. Fully feature complete YAML parser and emitter, supporting the latest YAML spec and passing the full YAML testsuite. It is designed to be very efficient, avoiding copies of data, and has no artificial limits like the 1024 character limit for implicit keys.
- **libyaml** [📁](./libyaml) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/libyaml) -- YAML
- **libyaml-examples** [📁](./libyaml-examples) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/libyaml-examples) -- a small set of C language example programs to demonstrate how to use the [libyaml library](http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML).
- **rapidyaml** [📁](./rapidyaml) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/rapidyaml) -- *Rapid YAML*, or `ryml`, for short. ryml is a C++ library to parse and emit YAML, and do it fast, on everything from x64 to bare-metal chips without operating system. `ryml` parses both read-only and in-situ source buffers; the resulting data nodes hold only views to sub-ranges of the source buffer. No string copies or duplications are done, and no virtual functions are used. The data tree is a flat index-based structure stored in a single array. Serialization happens only at your direct request, after parsing / before emitting. Internally, the data tree representation stores only string views and has no knowledge of types, but of course, every node can have a YAML type tag. `ryml` makes it easy and fast to read and modify the data tree.
- **yaml-cpp** [📁](./yaml-cpp) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/yaml-cpp) -- a YAML parser and emitter in C++ matching the YAML 1.2 spec.
- **yaml-test-suite** [📁](./yaml-test-suite) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/yaml-test-suite) -- comprehensive Test Suite for YAML
