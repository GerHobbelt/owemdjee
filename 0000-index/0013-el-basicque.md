### El BASICque

- **my_basic** [📁](./my_basic) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/my_basic) -- MY-BASIC is a lightweight BASIC interpreter written in standard C in dual files. It aims to be embeddable, extendable and portable. It is a dynamic typed programming language, reserves structured syntax, supports a style of [prototype-based programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming) (OOP), also implements a functional paradigm by [lambda abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function). The core is written in a C source file and an associated header file. It's easy to either use it as a standalone interpreter or embed it with existing projects in C, C++, Java, Objective-C, Swift, C#, etc. and totally customizable by adding your own scripting interface.
