for round-trip annotation and other "external application editing" of known documents; metadata embedding / *export*

- **PDFGen** [📁](./PDFGen) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/PDFGen) -- a simple PDF Creation/Generation library, contained in a single C-file with header and no external library dependencies. Useful for embedding into other programs that require rudimentary PDF output.
- **pdfgrep** [📁](./pdfgrep) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/pdfgrep) -- a tool to search text in PDF files. It works similarly to *grep*.
- **pdfium** [📁](./pdfium) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/pdfium) -- the PDF library used by the Chromium project.
- **podofo** [📁](./podofo) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/podofo) -- a library to work with the PDF file format and includes also a few tools. The name comes from the first two letters of PDF (<b>Po</b>rtable <b>Do</b>cument <b>Fo</b>rmat). The PoDoFo library is a free portable C++ library which includes classes to parse a PDF file and modify its contents into memory. The changes can be written back to disk easily. PoDoFo is designed to avoid loading large PDF objects into memory until they are required and can write large streams immediately to disk, so it is possible to manipulate quite large files with it.
- **poppler** [📁](./poppler) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/poppler) -- Poppler is a library for rendering PDF files, and examining or modifying their structure.  Poppler originally came from the XPDF sources.
- **qpdf** [📁](./qpdf) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/qpdf) -- QPDF is a command-line tool and C++ library that performs content-preserving transformations on PDF files. It supports linearization, encryption, and numerous other features. It can also be used for splitting and merging files, creating PDF files, and inspecting files for study or analysis. QPDF does not render PDFs or perform text extraction, and it does not contain higher-level interfaces for working with page contents. It is a low-level tool for working with the structure of PDF files and can be a valuable tool for anyone who wants to do programmatic or command-line-based manipulation of PDF files.
- **sioyek** [📁](./sioyek) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/sioyek) -- a PDF viewer with a focus on textbooks and research papers.
- **sumatrapdf** [📁](./sumatrapdf) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/sumatrapdf) -- SumatraPDF is a multi-format (PDF, EPUB, MOBI, CBZ, CBR, FB2, CHM, XPS, DjVu) reader for Windows.
- **XMP-Toolkit-SDK** [📁](./XMP-Toolkit-SDK) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/XMP-Toolkit-SDK) -- the XMP Toolkit allows you to integrate XMP functionality into your product, supplying an API for locating, adding, or updating the XMP metadata in a file.
- **xpdf** [📁](./xpdf) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/xpdf) -- Xpdf is an open source viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF) files.
