Moreover, it allows batch updating the citations, as they may change over time.
  
  **When updating multiple citations in a batch, it may happen that citation queries are blocked by Google Scholar for multiple automated requests. If a blockage happens, the add-on opens a browser window and directs it to http://scholar.google.com/, where you should see a Captcha displayed by Google Scholar, which you need to enter to get unblocked and then re-try updating the citations. It may happen that Google Scholar displays a message like the following "*We're sorry... but your computer or network may be sending automated queries. To protect our users, we can't process your request right now.*" In that case, the only solution is to wait for a while until Google unblocks you.**
