- **baobzi** [📁](./baobzi) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/baobzi) -- an adaptive fast function approximator based on tree search. Word salad aside, `baobzi` is a tool to convert very CPU intensive function calculations into relatively cheap ones (at the cost of memory). This is similar to functions like `chebeval` in `MATLAB`, but can be significantly faster since the order of the polynomial fit can be much much lower to meet similar tolerances. It also isn't constrained for use only in `MATLAB`. Internally, `baobzi` represents your function by a grid of binary/quad/oct/N trees, where the leaves represent the function in some small sub-box of the function's domain with chebyshev polynomials. When you evaluate your function at a point with baobzi, it searches the tree for the box containing your point and evaluates using this approximant.
