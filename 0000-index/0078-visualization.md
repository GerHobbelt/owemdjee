- **agg** [📁](./agg) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/agg) -- Anti-Grain Geometry library, written by Maxim Shemanarev in C++. It is an Open Source, 2D vector graphics library. Agg produces pixel images in memory from vectorial data. AGG doesn't depend on any graphic API or technology. Basically, you can think of AGG as of a rendering engine that produces pixel images in memory from some vectorial data.
- **butteraugli** [📁](./butteraugli) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/butteraugli) -- a tool for measuring perceived differences between images. Butteraugli is a project that estimates the psychovisual similarity of two images. It gives a score for the images that is reliable in the domain of barely noticeable differences. Butteraugli not only gives a scalar score, but also computes a spatial map of the level of differences. One of the main motivations for this project is the statistical differences in location and density of different color receptors, particularly the low density of blue cones in the fovea. Another motivation comes from more accurate modeling of ganglion cells, particularly the frequency space inhibition.

- **nodesoup** [📁](./nodesoup) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/nodesoup) -- delivers graph untangling: a force-directed graph layout simulates forces to give motion to vertices and arrange them in a way that is visually pleasing and/or reveals structure. The Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm assigns a repelling force to vertices pair of the graph, effectively pushing apart vertices so they don't overlap, and a attraction force between each adjacent vertices pair, thus dragging closer connected vertices. The forces attenuate when the vertices get respectively further apart or closer, and a global temperature also serves as a simulated annealing, capping the maximum vertex displacement at each iteration. As the forces between each component and the temperature gradually diminish, the layout stabilizes.  Another method, the Kamada Kawai algorithm, relies on the simulation of springs between each vertex, which strength is determined by the length of the shortest path between both vertices. The potential energy of each vertex, i.e. the sum of the energy of all its springs, is then computed. The goal being to reduce the global energy of the layout, each vertex is moved step-by-step until its potential energy is considered low-enough, using a Newton-Raphson algorithm.
