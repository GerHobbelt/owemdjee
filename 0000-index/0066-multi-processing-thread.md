### multi-processing: thread pools

- **concurrencpp** [📁](./concurrencpp) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/concurrencpp) -- the C++ concurrency library: concurrencpp is a tasking library for C++ allowing developers to write highly concurrent applications easily and safely by using tasks, executors and coroutines.
- **concurrentqueue** [📁](./concurrentqueue) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/concurrentqueue) -- moodycamel::ConcurrentQueue, an industrial-strength and fast multi-producer, multi-consumer lock-free concurrent queue for C++11.
- **CTPL-Thread-Pool** [📁](./CTPL-Thread-Pool) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/CTPL) -- Modern and efficient C++ Thread Pool Library. More specifically, there are some threads dedicated to the pool and a container of jobs. The jobs come to the pool dynamically. A job is fetched and deleted from the container when there is an idle thread. The job is then run on that thread.
- **pthreadpool** [📁](./pthreadpool) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/pthreadpool) -- pthreadpool is a portable and efficient thread pool implementation. It provides similar functionality to `#pragma omp parallel for`, but with additional features.
- **thread-pool** [📁](./thread-pool) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/thread-pool) -- `BS::thread_pool`: a fast, lightweight, and easy-to-use C++17 thread pool library (by Barak Shoshany)
- **thread-pool-c** [📁](./thread-pool-c) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/C-Thread-Pool) -- a minimal but advanced threadpool implementation.
- **thread-pool-cpp** [📁](./thread-pool-cpp) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/thread-pool-cpp) -- highly scalable and fast thread pool. It implements both work-stealing and work-distribution balancing startegies. It implements cooperative scheduling strategy.
- **YACLib** [📁](./YACLib) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/YACLib) -- YACLib is a lightweight C++ library for concurrent and parallel task execution.

abstraction without sacrificing performance. Whether you are targeting a single machine, a data center, or the cloud, CAF provides the necessary tools to implement robust, scalable, and maintainable software.

- **stdexec** [📁](./stdexec) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/stdexec) -- `stdexec` is an experimental reference implementation of the _Senders_ model of asynchronous programming proposed by [**P2300 - `std::execution`**](http://wg21.link/p2300) for adoption into the C++ Standard. _Senders_ is a Standard Model for Asynchronous Execution in C++.
