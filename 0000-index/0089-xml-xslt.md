## XML & XSLT tooling

- **gumbo-libxml** [📁](./gumbo-libxml) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/gumbo-libxml) -- LibXML2 bindings for the Gumbo HTML5 parser: this provides a libxml2 API on top of the Gumbo parser.  It lets you use a modern parser - Gumbo now passes all html5lib tests, including the template tag, and should be fully conformant with the HTML5 spec - with the full ecosystem of libxml tools, including XPath, tree modification, DTD validation, etc.
- **libexpat** [📁](./libexpat) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/libexpat) -- XML read/write
- **libxml2** [📁](./libxml2) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/libxml2) -- XML read/write
- **libxslt** [📁](./libxslt) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/libxslt) -- XSLT support for libxml2 (XML toolkit from the GNOME project)
- **rapidxml** [📁](./rapidxml) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/rapidxml) -- RapidXML is an ancient C++ library for parsing XML quickly and flexibly.
- **xml-pugixml** [📁](./xml-pugixml) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/pugixml) -- light-weight, simple and fast XML parser for C++ with XPath support.
- **xsldbg** [📁](./xsldbg) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/xsldbg) -- a debugger for xsl/xslt stylesheets which has functionality similar to a Unix/Linux "gdb", using libxml2 and libxslt.
