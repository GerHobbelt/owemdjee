- **baobzi** [📁](./baobzi) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/baobzi) -- an adaptive fast function approximator based on tree search. Word salad aside, `baobzi` is a tool to convert very CPU intensive function calculations into relatively cheap ones (at the cost of memory). This is similar to functions like `chebeval` in `MATLAB`, but can be significantly faster since the order of the polynomial fit can be much much lower to meet similar tolerances. It also isn't constrained for use only in `MATLAB`. Internally, `baobzi` represents your function by a grid of binary/quad/oct/N trees, where the leaves represent the function in some small sub-box of the function's domain with chebyshev polynomials. When you evaluate your function at a point with baobzi, it searches the tree for the box containing your point and evaluates using this approximant.

Performs DBSCAN over varying epsilon values and integrates the result to find a clustering that gives the best stability over epsilon. This allows HDBSCAN to find clusters of varying densities (unlike DBSCAN), and be more robust to parameter selection. In practice this means that HDBSCAN returns a good clustering straight away with little or no parameter tuning -- and the primary parameter, minimum cluster size, is intuitive and easy to select. HDBSCAN is ideal for exploratory data analysis; it's a fast and robust algorithm that you can trust to return meaningful clusters (if there are any).
