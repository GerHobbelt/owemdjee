If you have to change this manually, it's quite cumbersome to do. Luckily there exist tools to help. [Jabref](http://jabref.sourceforge.net) is open source bibliography reference manager. It has an option to abbreviate journal names. However, when it comes to Physics journals, the internal list is far from complete.
  
  The original list of abbreviations is located at [ISI](https://images.webofknowledge.com/images/help/WOS/A_abrvjt.html).
