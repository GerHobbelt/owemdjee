Data Science &amp; Image Processing amalgam library in C/C++.

This place is a gathering spot & integration workplace for the C & C++ libraries we choose to use.  Think "FaÃ§ade Pattern' and you're getting warm. :wink:
The heavy data lifting will be done in the referenced libraries, while this lib will provide some glue and common ground for them to work in/with.


## Reason for this repo

`git submodules` hasn't been the most, ah, "user-friendly" methods to track and manage a set of libraries that you wish to track at *source level*.

A few problems have been repeatedly observed over our lifetime with `git`:

- when it so happens that the importance & interest in a submoduled library is perhaps waning and you want to migrate to another, you can of course invoke `git` to ditch the old sow and bring in the shiny new one, but that stuff gets quite finicky when you are pedalling back & forth through your commit tree when, e.g. bughunting or maintenance work on a release branch which isn't up to snuff with the fashion kids yet. 

  Yup, that's been much less of a problem since about 2018, but old scars need more than a pat on the arm to heal, if you get my drift.
  
- folks haven't always been the happy campers they were supposed to be when they're facing a set of submodules and want to feel safe and sure in their "knowledge" that each library X is at commit Y, when the top of the module tree is itself at commit Z, for we are busy producing a production release, perhaps? That's a wee bit stressful and there have been enough "flukes" with git to make that a not-so-ironclad-as-we-would-like position. 

  Over time, [I've created several bash shell scripts to help with that buzzin' feelin' of *absolute certainty*](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/developer-utility-commands). Useful perhaps, but the cuteness of those wears off pretty darn quickly when many nodes in the submodule tree start cluttering their git repo with those.

  
### And?

This repo is made to ensure we have a single point of reference for all the data munching stuff, at least.

We don't need to `git submodule add` all those data processing libs in our applications this way, as this is a single submodule to bother that project with. The scripts and other material in here will provide the means to ensure your build and test tools can quickly and easily ensure that everyone in here is at the commit spot they're supposed to be.

And when we want to add another lib about data/image processing, we do that in here, so the application-level git repo sees a very stable singular submodule all the time: this repo/lib, not the stuff that will change over time as external libs gain and loose momentum over time. (We're talking multiyear timespans here!)


### Critique?

It's not the most brilliant solution to our problems, as this, of course, becomes a single point of failure that way, but experience in the past with similar "solutions" has shown that it's maybe not always fun, but at least we keep track of the management crap in one place and that was worth it, every time.

And why not do away with `git submodule` entirely and use packages instead? Because this stuff is important enough that *other, quite painful experience* has shown us that (binary & source) packages are a wonder and a hassle too: I'ld rather have my code tracked and tagged at source level **all the way** because that has reduced several bug situations from man-*weeks* to man-*hours*: like Gentoo, compile it all, one compiler only.  Doesn't matter if the bug is in your own code or elsewhere, there are enough moments like that where one is helped enormously by the ability to step through *and possibly tweak a bit of code here or there temporarily to help the debugging process* that I, at least, prefer full source code.

And that's what this repo is here to provide: the source code gathered and ready for use on our machines.



### Why is this repo a *solution*? And does it scale?

The worst bit first: it scales like rotten eggs. The problem there is two-fold: first, there's (relatively) few people who want to track progress at the bleeding edge, so tooling is consequently limited in power and availability, compared to conservative approaches (count the number of *package managers* lately?).

Meanwhile, I'm in a spot where I *want* to ride the bleeding edge, at least most of the time, and I happen to *like* it that way: my world is much more *R&D* than *product maintenance*, so having a means to track, relatively easy, the latest developments in subjects and materiel of interest is a boon to me. Sure, I'll moan and rant about it once in a while, but if I wanted to really get rid of the need to be flexible and *adapt to changes*, sometimes often, I'ld have gone with the conservative stability of *package managers* and *LTS releases* already. Which I've done for other parts of my environment, but do not intend to do for the part which is largely covered by this repo: source libraries which I intend to use or am using already in research tools I'm developing for others and myself.

For that purpose, this repo is a *solution*, though -- granted -- a *sub-optimal one* in that it doesn't scale very well. I don't think there's any automated process available to make this **significantly faster and more scalable** anyway: the fact that I'm riding the bleeding edge and wish to be able to backpedal at will when the latest change of direction or state of affairs of a component is off the rails (from my perspective at least), requires me to be flexible and adaptable to the full gamut of change. There are alternative approaches, also within the `git` world, but they haven't shown real appeal vs. *old skool* `git submodules` -- which is cranky at times and a pain in the neck when you want to ditch something but still need it in another dev branch, *moan moan moan*, but anyway... -- so here we are.

> **Side note**: submodules which have been picked up for experimentation and inspection **but have been deleted from this A list later on** are ~~struck through~~ in the overview below: the rationale there is that we can thus still observe **why** we struck it off the list, *plus* never make the mistake of re-introducing it after a long time, forgetting that we once had a look already, *without* running into the struck-through entry and having to re-evaluate the reason at least, before we re-introduce an item.

# Intent

## Inter-process communications (IPC)

Lowest possible **run-time** cost, a.k.a. "run-time overhead": the aim is to have IPC which does not noticably impact UX (User Experience of the application: responsiveness / UI) on reeasonably powered machines. (Users are *not* expected to have the latest or fastest hardware.)

As *at least* large images will be transfered (PDF page renders) we need to have a binary-able protocol.


## Programming Languages used: *intent and purposes*

We expect to use these languages in processes which require this type of IPC:

- JavaScript (**UI**, mostly. Think [*electron*](https://www.electronjs.org/), *web browser*, [*Chromely*](https://chromely.net/)<sup>[also](https://github.com/chromelyapps/Chromely)</sup>, [*WebView2*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/)<sup>[plus](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/)</sup>, that sort of thing)
- C / C++ (**backend No.1**)
  + PDF renderer ([mupdf](https://mupdf.com/))
  + metadata & annotations extractor ([mupdf](https://mupdf.com/) et al)
  + *very* probably also the database interface (SQLite)
  + \[page] image processing (leptonica, openCV, ImageMagick?, what-ever turns out to be useful and reasonable to integrate (particularly between PDF page renderer and OCR engine to help us provide a *user-tunable* PDF text+metadata extractor
  + OCR (tesseract)
  + "A.I."-assisted tooling to help process and *clean* PDFs: cover pages, abstract/summary extraction for meta-research, etc. (think ngrams, xdelta, SVM, tensors, author identification, document categorization, document similarity / \[*near*-]duplicate / revision detection, tagging, ...)
  + document identifier key generator a.k.a. **content hasher** for creating **unique** key for each document, which can be used as database record index, etc.
    * old: Qiqqa SHA1B
    * new: BLAKE3+Base36
- C# (**"business logic" / "middleware"**: the glue logic)
- Java (SOLR / Lucene: our choice for the "full text search database" ~ **backend No.2**)

Here we *intend* to use the regular SOLR APIs, which does not require specialized binary IPC.

We **may** **probably** choose to use a web-centric UI approach where images are *compressed* and *cached* in the *backend*, while being provided as \<picture> or \<img> tag references (URLs) in the HTML generated by the backend. *However*, we keep our options open ATM as furtheer testing is expected to hit a few obstacles there (smart caching required as we will be processing lots of documents in "background **bulk processes**" alongside the browsing and other more *direct* user activity) so a *websocket* or similar push technology may be employed: there we may benefit from dedicated IPC for large binary and text data transfers.


## Scripting the System: Languages Considered for Scripting by Users

Python has been considered. Given its loud presence in the AI communities, we still may integrate it one day. However, personally I'm not a big fan of the language and don't use it unless it's *prudent to do*, e.g. when extending or tweaking previous works produced by others. 
Also, it turns out, it's not exactly *easy* to integrate (CPython) and I don't see a need for it beyond this one project / product: Qiqqa.

I've looked at Lua for a scripting language suitable for users (used quite a lot in the gaming industries and elsewhere); initial trials to get something going did not uncover major obstacles, but the question "_how do I **debug** Lua scripts?_" does not produce any viable project / product that goes beyond the *old skool `printf`-style debugging method*. Not a prime candidate therefor, as we expect that users will pick this up, when they like it, and grow the user scripts to unanticipated size and complexity: I've seen this happen multiple times in my career. Lua does not provide a scalable growth path from my perspective due to the lack of a *decent, customizable, debugger*.

Third candidate is JavaScript. While Artifex/mupdf comes with `mujs`, which is a simple engine it suffers from *two* drawbacks: it's ES5 and also does not provide a debugger mechanism beyond old skool `print`. Nice for nerds, but this is user-facing and thus not a viable option.

The other JavaScript engines considered are of varying size, performance and complexity. *Some* of them offer ways to integrate them with the \[F12] Chrome browser Developer Tools debugger, which would be *very nice to have available*. The road traveled there, along the various JavaScript engines is this:

- mujs: ES5, no visual debugger. **Out.**
- jerryscript: ES2017/2020 (good!), there's noises about Chrome Developer Tools on the Net for this one. Small, designed for embedded devices. I like that.
- [Facebook's Hermes](https://github.com/facebook/hermes), [Samsung's Escargot](https://github.com/Samsung/escargot) and [XS/moddable](https://www.moddable.com/)<sup>[also](https://github.com/Moddable-OpenSource/moddable) [here](https://github.com/Moddable-OpenSource/moddable-xst)</sup>, which led me to [a webpage where various embeddable JS engines are compared size- and *performance*-wise](https://bellard.org/quickjs/bench.html).
- [QuickJS](https://github.com/bellard/quickjs): ES2020, DevTools or [VS Code debugging](https://github.com/koush/vscode-quickjs-debug) seems to be available. Also comes with an interesting runtime: [txiki](https://github.com/saghul/txiki.js), which we still need to take a good look at.
- [Google's V8](https://v8.dev/)<sup>[here](https://github.com/v8/v8) [too](https://chromium.googlesource.com/v8/v8/+/84450a2239672109bcf537d6740b8babda521567)</sup>, as available in NodeJS, is deemed too complex for integration: when we go there, we could spend the same amount of effort on CPython integration -- though there again is the ever-present "how to debug this visually?!" question...)

- [ScriptX](./ScriptX/) -- Tencent's [ScriptX](https://github.com/Tencent/ScriptX) is a script engine abstraction layer. A variety of script engines are encapsulated on the bottom and a unified API is exposed on the top, so that the upper-layer caller can completely isolate the underlying engine implementation (back-end).

  ScriptX not only isolates several JavaScript engines (e.g. V8 and QuickJS), but can even isolate different scripting languages, so that the upper layer can seamlessly switch between scripting engine and scripting language without changing the code.

**UPDATE 2021/June**: jerryscript, duktape, XS/moddable, escargot: these have been dropped as we picked QuickJS. After some initial hassle with that codebase, we picked a different branch to test, which was cleaner and compiled out of the box (CMake > MSVC), which is always a good omen for a codebase when you have cross-platform portability in mind.

# Libraries we're looking at for this *intent*:

- **IPC: flatbuffer et al for protocol design**:

    - [bebop](./bebop)
    - ~~[FastBinaryEncoding](https://github.com/chronoxor/FastBinaryEncoding)~~
      + **removed**; reason: for binary format record serialization we will be using `bebop` exclusively. All other communications will be JSON/JSON5/XML based.
    - ~~[flatbuffers](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers)~~
      + **removed**; reason: see `protobuf`: same smell rising. Faster at run time, but still a bit hairy to my tastes while `bebop` et al are on to something *potentially nice*.
    - ~~[flatcc](https://github.com/dvidelabs/flatcc)~~
      + **removed**; reason: see `flatbuffers`. When we don't dig `flatbuffers`, then `flatcc` is automatically pretty useless to us. Let's rephrase that professionally: "`flatcc` has moved out of scope for our project."
    - [cereal](./cereal) -- C++11 serialization library
    - ZeroMQ a.k.a. ÃMQ:
        + [libzmq](./libzmq) -- ZeroMQ core engine in C++, implements [ZMTP/3.1](https://zguide.zeromq.org/).
        + [cppzmq](./cppzmq) -- header-only C++ binding for libzmq.
        + [libCZMQ](../libCZMQ) -- High-level C binding for ÃMQ. (http://czmq.zeromq.org/)
    - ~~[libsmile](https://github.com/pierre/libsmile) -- ["Smile" format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smile_%28data_interchange_format%29), i.e. a compact binary JSON format~~
      + **removed**; reason: for binary format record serialization we will be using `bebop` exclusively. All other communications will be JSON/JSON5/XML based.
    - ~~[protobuf](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf)~~
      + **removed**; reason: relatively slow run-time and (in my opinion) rather ugly & convoluted approach at build time. Has too much of a Java/CorporateProgramming smell, which has not lessened over the years, unfortunately.
    - ~~[SWIG](https://swig.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Manual/SWIG.html) (*not included; more suitable for RPC than what we have in mind, which is purely data messages enchange*)~~
	- [velocypack](../velocypack): a fast and compact format for serialization and storage.  These days, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation, see ECMA-404) is used in many cases where data has to be exchanged. Lots of protocols between different services use it, databases store JSON (document stores naturally, but others increasingly as well). It is popular, because it is simple, human-readable, and yet surprisingly versatile, despite its limitations. At the same time there is a plethora of alternatives ranging from XML over Universal Binary JSON, MongoDB's BSON, MessagePack, BJSON (binary JSON), Apache Thrift till Google's protocol buffers and ArangoDB's shaped JSON. When looking into this, we were surprised to find that none of these formats manages to combine compactness, platform independence, fast access to sub-objects and rapid conversion from and to JSON.

- **IPC: websockets, etc.: all communication means**

    - [libwebsocketpp](./libwebsocketpp)
    - [libwebsockets](./libwebsockets)
    - [websocket-sharp](./websocket-sharp)
    - [OpenSSL](./openssl) -- also used by cURL et al, incidentally.
    - [crow](./crow) -- IPC / server framework 
     
      Interface looks nicer than `oatpp`...
    - ~~[oatpp](https://github.com/oatpp/oatpp) -- IPC / server framework~~
      + **removed**; reason: see `crow`. We have picked `crow` as the preferred way forward, so any similar/competing product is out of scope unless `crow` throws a tantrum on our test bench after all, the chances of that being *very slim*.
    - ~~[ice](https://github.com/zeroc-ice/ice) -- Comprehensive RPC Framework: helps you network your software with minimal effort.~~
      + **removed**; reason: has a strong focus on the *remote*, i.e. `R` in `RPC` (thus a focus on things such as encryption, authentication, firewalling, etc.), which we don't want or need: all services are supposed to run on a single machine and comms go through `localhost` *only*. When folks find they need to distribute the workload across multiple machines, then we'll be entering a new era in Qiqqa usage and then will be soon enough to (re-)investigate the usefulness of this package.
      
        Also, we are currently more interested in *fast data serialization* then RPC *per se* as we aim for a solution that's more akin to a REST API interface style.

    - [WinHttpPAL](./WinHttpPAL) -- implements [WinHttp API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winhttp/winhttp-start-page) Platform Abstraction Layer for POSIX systems using libcurl
    - ZeroMQ a.k.a. ÃMQ:
        + [libzmq](./libzmq) -- ZeroMQ core engine in C++, implements [ZMTP/3.1](https://zguide.zeromq.org/).
        + [cppzmq](./cppzmq) -- header-only C++ binding for libzmq.
        + [libCZMQ](../libCZMQ) -- High-level C binding for ÃMQ. (http://czmq.zeromq.org/)

- **IPC: JSON for protocol design**:

    - [json](./json)
    - [json-jansson](./json-jansson)
    - [rapidJSON](./rapidJSON)
    - [yyjson](./yyjson)
    - [libsmile](./libsmile) -- ["Smile" format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smile_%28data_interchange_format%29), i.e. a compact binary JSON format

- ~~**IPC: YAML, TOML, etc. for protocol design**~~:

    **Not considered**: reason: when we want the IPC protocol to be "human readable" in any form/approximation, we've decided to stick with JSON or XML (if we cannot help it -- I particularly dislike the verbosity and tag redundancy (open+close) in XML and consider it a lousy design choice for *any* purpose).

    The more human readable formats (YAML, TOML, ...) are intended for human to machine communications, e.g. for feeding configurations into applications, and **SHOULD NOT** be used for IPC anywhere. (Though I must say I'm on the fence where it comes using YAML as an alternative IPC format where it replaces JSON; another contender there are the JSON5/JSON6 formats.)

- **content hashing** (cryptographic strength i.e. *"guaranteed"* collision-free)
    
    The bit about **_"guaranteed"_ collision-free** is to be read as: hash algorithms in this section must come with *strong statistical guarantees* that any chance at a **hash collision** is negligible, even for *extremely large* collections. In practice this means: use *cryptographic* hash algorithms with a *strength* of 128 bits or more. (Qiqqa used a b0rked version SHA1 thus far, which is considered too weak as we already sample PDFs which cause a hash collision for the *official* SHA1 algo (and thus also collide in our b0rked SHA1 variant): while those can still be argued to be fringe case, I don't want to be bothered with this at all and thus choose to err on the side of 'better than SHA1B' here. Meanwhile, any library in here *may* contain weaker cryptographic hashes alongside: we won't be using those for **content hashing**.
  
    - [BLAKE3](./BLAKE3) -- cryptographic hash
    - [cryptopp](./cryptopp) -- crypto library
    - [OpenSSL](./openssl) -- its crypto library part, more specifically.

- **hash-like filters & fast hashing for hash tables** et al (64 bits and less, mostly)

    These hashes are for other purposes, e.g. fast lookup in dictionaries, fast approximate hit testing and set reduction through fast filtering (think *bloom filter*). These *may* be **machine specific** (and some of them *are*): these are **never supposed to be used for encoding in storage or other means which crosses machine boundaries**: if you want to use them for a database index, that is fine *as long as* you don't expect that database index to be readable by any other machine than the one which produced and uses these hash numbers.
  
    > As you can see from the list below, I went on a shopping spree, having fun with all the latest, including some *possibly insane* stuff that's only really useful for particular edge cases -- which we *hope to avoid ourselves, for a while at least*. Anyway, I'ld say we've got the motherlode here. Simple fun for those days when your brain-flag is at half-mast. Enjoy.

          + **removed**; reason: see the `HDF5` entry below.
        + ~~[HDF5](./HDF5)~~
          + **removed**; reason: HDF5 is a nice concept but considered *overkill* right now; where we need disk stores, we'll be using SQLite or LMDB-like key-value stores instead. Such stores are not meant to be interchangeable with other software in their raw shape and we'll provide public access APIs instead, where applicable.
        + ~~[HighFive-HDF5](./HighFive-HDF5)~~
          + **removed**; reason: see the `HDF5` entry above.
    - RAM-/disk-based large queues and stores: B+tree, LSM-tree, ...
        + [cpp-btree](../cpp-btree) -- in-memory B+-tree: an alternative for the priority queue as we expect the queue to grow huge, given past experience with Qiqqa.
        + [tlx-btree](./tlx-btree) -- in-memory B+-tree: an alternative for the priority queue as we expect the queue to grow huge, given past experience with Qiqqa.

    - [librsync](../librsync) -- a library for calculating and applying network deltas. librsync encapsulates the core algorithms of the rsync protocol, which help with efficient calculation of the differences between two files. The rsync algorithm is different from most differencing algorithms because it does not require the presence of the two files to calculate the delta.  Instead, it requires a set of checksums of each block of one file, which together form a signature for that file.  Blocks at any position in the other file which have the same checksum are likely to be identical, and whatever remains is the difference. This algorithm transfers the differences between two files without needing both files on the same system.

    - [zsync2](../zsync2) -- the advanced file download/sync tool zsync. zsync is a well known tool for downloading and updating local files from HTTP servers using the well known algorithms rsync used for diffing binary files. Therefore, it becomes possible to synchronize modifications by exchanging the changed blocks locally using `Range:` requests. The system is based on meta files called `.zsync` files. They contain hash sums for every block of data. The file is generated from and stored along with the actual file it refers to. Due to how system works, nothing but a "dumb" HTTP server is required to make use of zsync2. This makes it easy to integrate zsync2 into existing systems.

    - [csync2](../csync2) -- a cluster synchronization tool. It can be used to keep files on multiple hosts in a cluster in sync. Csync2 can handle complex setups with much more than just 2 hosts, handle file deletions and can detect conflicts.

	- **similarity search**:
		- [annoy](../annoy): Annoy (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah) is a C++ library with Python bindings to search for points in space that are close to a given query point. It also creates large read-only file-based data structures that are mmapped into memory so that many processes may share the same data. Annoy is almost as fast as the fastest libraries, but there is actually another feature that really sets Annoy apart: it has the ability to use static files as indexes. In particular, this means you can share index across processes. Annoy also decouples creating indexes from loading them, so you can pass around indexes as files and map them into memory quickly. Another nice thing of Annoy is that it tries to minimize memory footprint so the indexes are quite small. Why is this useful? If you want to find nearest neighbors and you have many CPU's, you only need to build the index once. You can also pass around and distribute static files to use in production environment: any process will be able to load (`mmap`) the index into memory and will be able to do lookups immediately. We use it at Spotify for music recommendations. After running matrix factorization algorithms, every user/item can be represented as a vector in f-dimensional space. This library helps us search for similar users/items. We have many millions of tracks in a high-dimensional space, so memory usage is a prime concern.
		- [CTCWordBeamSearch](../CTCWordBeamSearch): Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) decoder with dictionary and Language Model (LM).
		- [faiss](../faiss): a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.

No support for approximate NN is provided. This library is a fork of the `flann` library by Marius Muja and David G. Lowe, and born as a child project of `MRPT`.
		- [nmslib](../nmslib): Non-Metric Space Library (NMSLIB) is an efficient cross-platform similarity search library and a toolkit for evaluation of similarity search methods. The core-library does not have any third-party dependencies. It has been gaining popularity recently. In particular, it has become a part of Amazon Elasticsearch Service. The goal of the project is to create an effective and comprehensive toolkit for searching in generic and non-metric spaces. Even though the library contains a variety of metric-space access methods, our main focus is on generic and approximate search methods, in particular, on methods for non-metric spaces. NMSLIB is possibly the first library with a principled support for non-metric space searching.
		- [xgboost](../xgboost): an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible and portable.

It allows researchers to experiment with state-of-the-art techniques, allowing an ideal environment for rapid development. PISA is a text search engine, though the "PISA Project" is a set of tools that help experiment with indexing and query processing. Given a text collection, PISA can build an inverted index over this corpus, allowing the corpus to be searched. The inverted index, put simply, is an efficient data structure that represents the document corpus by storing a list of documents for each unique term (see here). At query time, PISA stores its index in main memory for rapid retrieval.

        The additional (and more important) reason to ditch CPython from the R&D set is hairiness of integrating Python into an application as an embedded scripting language, instead of the other way around. With the envisioned advent of ZeroMQ/socket based IPC, any Python scripts can hook into that instead of spending the effort and maintenance of having that large language as an embedded 'assistive' scripting/configuration language: it's simply too huge and complicated.

      - [enkiTS](./enkiTS-TaskScheduler) -- A C++11 Task Scheduler for creating parallel programs.
     
        Features:
        - Lightweight
        - Fast, then scalable - designed for consumer devices first, so performance on a low number of threads is important, followed by scalability.
        - Braided parallelism - can issue tasks from another task as well as from the thread which created the Task System, and has a simple task interface for both data and task parallelism.
        - Up-front Allocation friendly - designed for zero allocations during scheduling.
        - Can pin tasks to a given thread - can schedule a task which will only be run on the specified thread.
        - Can set task priorities - Up to 5 task priorities can be configured via define ENKITS_TASK_PRIORITIES_NUM (defaults to 3). Higher priority tasks are run before lower priority ones.
        - Can register external threads to use with enkiTS
        - Dependencies - can set dependencies between tasks.
        - Completion Actions - can perform an action on task completion. This avoids the expensive action of adding the task to the scheduler, and can be used to safely delete a completed task.
        - Can wait for pinned tasks - useful for creating IO threads which do no other work.
		
      - [google::marl](./google-marl) -- a hybrid thread / fiber task scheduler written in C++ 11. Marl uses a combination of fibers and threads to allow efficient execution of tasks that can block, while keeping a fixed number of hardware threads.
      - [taskflow](./taskflow) -- Quickly write parallel and heterogeneous task programs in modern C++. Taskflow is faster, more expressive, and easier for drop-in integration than many of existing task programming frameworks in handling complex parallel workloads.

    - **Promise/A+**

      The key distinction between Promises/A+ and `std::promise` in C++11 is that Promises/A+ provides non-blocking synchronization (via chaining function objects) and `std::promise` provides blocking synchronization (or polling). Both have their uses and one is not a direct replacement for the other.

      IMPORTANT NOTE: there is one major difference, though. Most modern Javascript promises (including JS Native promises) resolve asynchronously, i.e. their `resolve()` method does not directly call the `then()` handlers, but schedules the calls on the next message loop iteration. The same happens when a `then()`/`catch()` handler is attached to an already resolved/rejected promise. This may be a bit less efficient, but makes the behavior symmetric and more predictable. These libraries *SHOULD* resolve synchronously, because they are unaware of the message loop that is used in the application. (Look into task schedulers above for when you need such awareness, e.g. `taskflow`.)

# Libraries in this collection (All of the above, listed in alphabetical order)

- [annoy](../annoy): Annoy (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah) is a C++ library with Python bindings to search for points in space that are close to a given query point. It also creates large read-only file-based data structures that are mmapped into memory so that many processes may share the same data. Annoy is almost as fast as the fastest libraries, but there is actually another feature that really sets Annoy apart: it has the ability to use static files as indexes. In particular, this means you can share index across processes. Annoy also decouples creating indexes from loading them, so you can pass around indexes as files and map them into memory quickly. Another nice thing of Annoy is that it tries to minimize memory footprint so the indexes are quite small. Why is this useful? If you want to find nearest neighbors and you have many CPU's, you only need to build the index once. You can also pass around and distribute static files to use in production environment: any process will be able to load (`mmap`) the index into memory and will be able to do lookups immediately. We use it at Spotify for music recommendations. After running matrix factorization algorithms, every user/item can be represented as a vector in f-dimensional space. This library helps us search for similar users/items. We have many millions of tracks in a high-dimensional space, so memory usage is a prime concern.

- [libvrb](../libvrb): implements a ring buffer, also known as a character FIFO or circular buffer, with a special property that any data present in the buffer, as well as any empty space, are always seen as a single contiguous extent by the calling program.  This is implemented with virtual memory mapping by creating a mirror image of the buffer contents at the memory location in the virtual address space immediately after the main buffer location.  This allows the mirror image to always be seen without doing any copying of data.

- [highwayhash](../highwayhash): Fast strong hash functions: SipHash/HighwayHash
- [nsync](../nsync): a C library that exports various synchronization primitives. `nsync` may be desirable in place of `pthread` primitives in some cases:  (1) nsync locks are reader-writer locks (but are as efficient as mutexes).  (2) nsync locks and condition variables occupy only two words each.  (3) nsync works on Unix-like systems and Windows.  It should be portable to other platforms straightforwardly.  (4) nsync provides conditional critical sections.  These fill the same role as condition variables, but are usually easier to use, and in most common cases are comparable in speed.  They can be easier to use in two ways:  (A) it's not necessary to surround the "wait" operation in a while loop; instead the condition is passed to the call as a function and arbitrary pointer argument.  (B) it's not necessary to wake or signal explicitly when the condition(s) become true; they are checked automatically. The primary downsides are:  (A) they are not available in most other common synchronization APIs, and so they may be unfamiliar (even though they date back to the 1960s), and (B) if threads routinely wait on many distinct, false conditions associated with the same lock, they may be slower than condition variables. In this case, clients can use condition variables in the normal way; conditional critical sections and condition variables can be used with the same lock.  (5) nsync waits can be cancelled via an object passed to the wait calls, unlike the pthread model in which threads are cancelled.  This difference can be useful if the computation needs multiple threads, or if cancellation affects only sub-operations within a larger operation by the thread.
- [zfp-compressed-arrays](../zfp-compressed-arrays): zfp is a compressed format for representing multidimensional floating-point and integer arrays. zfp provides compressed-array classes that support high throughput read and write random access to individual array elements. zfp also supports serial and parallel (OpenMP and CUDA) compression of whole arrays, e.g., for applications that read and write large data sets to and from disk.
