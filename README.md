Data Science &amp; Image Processing amalgam library in C/C++.

This place is a gathering spot & integration workplace for the C & C++ libraries we choose to use.  Think "FaÃ§ade Pattern' and you're getting warm. :wink:
The heavy data lifting will be done in the referenced libraries, while this lib will provide some glue and common ground for them to work in/with.


## Reason for this repo

`git submodules` hasn't been the most, ah, "user-friendly" methods to track and manage a set of libraries that you wish to track at *source level*.

A few problems have been repeatedly observed over our lifetime with `git`:

- when it so happens that the importance & interest in a submoduled library is perhaps waning and you want to migrate to another, you can of course invoke `git` to ditch the old sow and bring in the shiny new one, but that stuff gets quite finicky when you are pedalling back & forth through your commit tree when, e.g. bughunting or maintenance work on a release branch which isn't up to snuff with the fashion kids yet.

  Yup, that's been much less of a problem since about 2018, but old scars need more than a pat on the arm to heal, if you get my drift.

- folks haven't always been the happy campers they were supposed to be when they're facing a set of submodules and want to feel safe and sure in their "knowledge" that each library X is at commit Y, when the top of the module tree is itself at commit Z, for we are busy producing a production release, perhaps? That's a wee bit stressful and there have been enough "flukes" with git to make that a not-so-ironclad-as-we-would-like position.

  Over time, [I've created several bash shell scripts to help with that buzzin' feelin' of *absolute certainty*](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/developer-utility-commands). Useful perhaps, but the cuteness of those wears off pretty darn quickly when many nodes in the submodule tree start cluttering their git repo with those.


### And?

This repo is made to ensure we have a single point of reference for all the data munching stuff, at least.

We don't need to `git submodule add` all those data processing libs in our applications this way, as this is a single submodule to bother that project with. The scripts and other material in here will provide the means to ensure your build and test tools can quickly and easily ensure that everyone in here is at the commit spot they're supposed to be.

And when we want to add another lib about data/image processing, we do that in here, so the application-level git repo sees a very stable singular submodule all the time: this repo/lib, not the stuff that will change over time as external libs gain and loose momentum over time. (We're talking multiyear timespans here!)


### Critique?

It's not the most brilliant solution to our problems, as this, of course, becomes a single point of failure that way, but experience in the past with similar "solutions" has shown that it's maybe not always fun, but at least we keep track of the management crap in one place and that was worth it, every time.

And why not do away with `git submodule` entirely and use packages instead? Because this stuff is important enough that *other, quite painful experience* has shown us that (binary & source) packages are a wonder and a hassle too: I'ld rather have my code tracked and tagged at source level **all the way** because that has reduced several bug situations from man-*weeks* to man-*hours*: like Gentoo, compile it all, one compiler only.  Doesn't matter if the bug is in your own code or elsewhere, there are enough moments like that where one is helped enormously by the ability to step through *and possibly tweak a bit of code here or there temporarily to help the debugging process* that I, at least, prefer full source code.

And that's what this repo is here to provide: the source code gathered and ready for use on our machines.



### Why is this repo a *solution*? And does it scale?

The worst bit first: it scales like rotten eggs. The problem there is two-fold: first, there's (relatively) few people who want to track progress at the bleeding edge, so tooling is consequently limited in power and availability, compared to conservative approaches (count the number of *package managers* lately?).

Meanwhile, I'm in a spot where I *want* to ride the bleeding edge, at least most of the time, and I happen to *like* it that way: my world is much more *R&D* than *product maintenance*, so having a means to track, relatively easy, the latest developments in subjects and materiel of interest is a boon to me. Sure, I'll moan and rant about it once in a while, but if I wanted to really get rid of the need to be flexible and *adapt to changes*, sometimes often, I'ld have gone with the conservative stability of *package managers* and *LTS releases* already. Which I've done for other parts of my environment, but do not intend to do for the part which is largely covered by this repo: source libraries which I intend to use or am using already in research tools I'm developing for others and myself.

For that purpose, this repo is a *solution*, though -- granted -- a *sub-optimal one* in that it doesn't scale very well. I don't think there's any automated process available to make this **significantly faster and more scalable** anyway: the fact that I'm riding the bleeding edge and wish to be able to backpedal at will when the latest change of direction or state of affairs of a component is off the rails (from my perspective at least), requires me to be flexible and adaptable to the full gamut of change. There are alternative approaches, also within the `git` world, but they haven't shown real appeal vs. *old skool* `git submodules` -- which is cranky at times and a pain in the neck when you want to ditch something but still need it in another dev branch, *moan moan moan*, but anyway... -- so here we are.

> **Side note**: submodules which have been picked up for experimentation and inspection **but have been deleted from this A list later on** are ~~struck through~~ in the overview below: the rationale there is that we can thus still observe **why** we struck it off the list, *plus* never make the mistake of re-introducing it after a long time, forgetting that we once had a look already, *without* running into the struck-through entry and having to re-evaluate the reason at least, before we re-introduce an item.

# Intent

## Inter-process communications (IPC)

Lowest possible **run-time** cost, a.k.a. "run-time overhead": the aim is to have IPC which does not noticably impact UX (User Experience of the application: responsiveness / UI) on reeasonably powered machines. (Users are *not* expected to have the latest or fastest hardware.)

As *at least* large images will be transfered (PDF page renders) we need to have a binary-able protocol.


## Programming Languages used: *intent and purposes*

We expect to use these languages in processes which require this type of IPC:

- JavaScript (**UI**, mostly. Think [*electron*](https://www.electronjs.org/), *web browser*, [*Chromely*](https://chromely.net/)<sup>[also](https://github.com/chromelyapps/Chromely)</sup>, [*WebView2*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/)<sup>[plus](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/)</sup>, that sort of thing)
- C / C++ (**backend No.1**)
  + PDF renderer ([mupdf](https://mupdf.com/))
  + metadata & annotations extractor ([mupdf](https://mupdf.com/) et al)
  + *very* probably also the database interface (SQLite)
  + \[page] image processing (leptonica, openCV, ImageMagick?, what-ever turns out to be useful and reasonable to integrate (particularly between PDF page renderer and OCR engine to help us provide a *user-tunable* PDF text+metadata extractor
  + OCR (tesseract)
  + "A.I."-assisted tooling to help process and *clean* PDFs: cover pages, abstract/summary extraction for meta-research, etc. (think ngrams, xdelta, SVM, tensors, author identification, document categorization, document similarity / \[*near*-]duplicate / revision detection, tagging, ...)
  + document identifier key generator a.k.a. **content hasher** for creating **unique** key for each document, which can be used as database record index, etc.
    * old: Qiqqa SHA1B
    * new: BLAKE3+Base36
- C# (**"business logic" / "middleware"**: the glue logic)
- Java (SOLR / Lucene: our choice for the "full text search database" ~ **backend No.2**)

Here we *intend* to use the regular SOLR APIs, which does not require specialized binary IPC.

We **may** **probably** choose to use a web-centric UI approach where images are *compressed* and *cached* in the *backend*, while being provided as \<picture> or \<img> tag references (URLs) in the HTML generated by the backend. *However*, we keep our options open ATM as furtheer testing is expected to hit a few obstacles there (smart caching required as we will be processing lots of documents in "background **bulk processes**" alongside the browsing and other more *direct* user activity) so a *websocket* or similar push technology may be employed: there we may benefit from dedicated IPC for large binary and text data transfers.


## Scripting the System: Languages Considered for Scripting by Users

Python has been considered. Given its loud presence in the AI communities, we still may integrate it one day. However, personally I'm not a big fan of the language and don't use it unless it's *prudent to do*, e.g. when extending or tweaking previous works produced by others.
Also, it turns out, it's not exactly *easy* to integrate (CPython) and I don't see a need for it beyond this one project / product: Qiqqa.

I've looked at Lua for a scripting language suitable for users (used quite a lot in the gaming industries and elsewhere); initial trials to get something going did not uncover major obstacles, but the question "_how do I **debug** Lua scripts?_" does not produce any viable project / product that goes beyond the *old skool `printf`-style debugging method*. Not a prime candidate therefor, as we expect that users will pick this up, when they like it, and grow the user scripts to unanticipated size and complexity: I've seen this happen multiple times in my career. Lua does not provide a scalable growth path from my perspective due to the lack of a *decent, customizable, debugger*.

Third candidate is JavaScript. While Artifex/mupdf comes with `mujs`, which is a simple engine it suffers from *two* drawbacks: it's ES5 and also does not provide a debugger mechanism beyond old skool `print`. Nice for nerds, but this is user-facing and thus not a viable option.

The other JavaScript engines considered are of varying size, performance and complexity. *Some* of them offer ways to integrate them with the \[F12] Chrome browser Developer Tools debugger, which would be *very nice to have available*. The road traveled there, along the various JavaScript engines is this:

- mujs: ES5, no visual debugger. **Out.**
- jerryscript: ES2017/2020 (good!), there's noises about Chrome Developer Tools on the Net for this one. Small, designed for embedded devices. I like that.
- [Facebook's Hermes](https://github.com/facebook/hermes), [Samsung's Escargot](https://github.com/Samsung/escargot) and [XS/moddable](https://www.moddable.com/)<sup>[also](https://github.com/Moddable-OpenSource/moddable) [here](https://github.com/Moddable-OpenSource/moddable-xst)</sup>, which led me to [a webpage where various embeddable JS engines are compared size- and *performance*-wise](https://bellard.org/quickjs/bench.html).
- [QuickJS](https://github.com/bellard/quickjs): ES2020, DevTools or [VS Code debugging](https://github.com/koush/vscode-quickjs-debug) seems to be available. Also comes with an interesting runtime: [txiki](https://github.com/saghul/txiki.js), which we still need to take a good look at.
- [Google's V8](https://v8.dev/)<sup>[here](https://github.com/v8/v8) [too](https://chromium.googlesource.com/v8/v8/+/84450a2239672109bcf537d6740b8babda521567)</sup>, as available in NodeJS, is deemed too complex for integration: when we go there, we could spend the same amount of effort on CPython integration -- though there again is the ever-present "how to debug this visually?!" question...)

- **ScriptX** [ð](./ScriptX) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/ScriptX) -- Tencent's [ScriptX](https://github.com/Tencent/ScriptX) is a script engine abstraction layer. A variety of script engines are encapsulated on the bottom and a unified API is exposed on the top, so that the upper-layer caller can completely isolate the underlying engine implementation (back-end).

  ScriptX not only isolates several JavaScript engines (e.g. V8 and QuickJS), but can even isolate different scripting languages, so that the upper layer can seamlessly switch between scripting engine and scripting language without changing the code.

**UPDATE 2021/June**: jerryscript, duktape, XS/moddable, escargot: these have been dropped as we picked QuickJS. After some initial hassle with that codebase, we picked a different branch to test, which was cleaner and compiled out of the box (CMake > MSVC), which is always a good omen for a codebase when you have cross-platform portability in mind.

# Libraries we're looking at for this *intent*:

- ## IPC: flatbuffer et al for protocol design

- **bebop** [ð](./bebop) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/bebop) -- an extremely simple, fast, efficient, cross-platform serialization format. Bebop is a schema-based binary serialization technology, similar to Protocol Buffers or MessagePack. In particular, Bebop tries to be a good fit for clientâserver or distributed web apps that need something faster, more concise, and more type-safe than JSON or MessagePack, while also avoiding some of the complexity of Protocol Buffers, FlatBuffers and the like.

- **cereal** [ð](./cereal) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/cereal) -- C++11 serialization library

- **SWIG** [ð](https://swig.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Manual/SWIG.html) (*Was not considered initially; more suitable for RPC than what we have in mind, which is purely data messages enchange. MAY be of use for transitional applications which are mixed-(programming-)language based, e.g. where we want to mix C/C++ and C# in a single Test Application.*)
    
    - **swig**  [ð](./swig) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/swig) -- a software development tool (code generator) that connects programs written in C and C++ with a variety of high-level programming languages.


- **velocypack** [ð](./velocypack) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/velocypack) -- a fast and compact format for serialization and storage.  These days, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation, see ECMA-404) is used in many cases where data has to be exchanged. Lots of protocols between different services use it, databases store JSON (document stores naturally, but others increasingly as well). It is popular, because it is simple, human-readable, and yet surprisingly versatile, despite its limitations. At the same time there is a plethora of alternatives ranging from XML over Universal Binary JSON, MongoDB's BSON, MessagePack, BJSON (binary JSON), Apache Thrift till Google's protocol buffers and ArangoDB's shaped JSON. When looking into this, we were surprised to find that none of these formats manages to combine compactness, platform independence, fast access to sub-objects and rapid conversion from and to JSON.

- ZeroMQ a.k.a. ÃMQ:
    - **cppzmq** [ð](./cppzmq) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/cppzmq) -- header-only C++ binding for libzmq.
    - **libCZMQ** [ð](./libCZMQ) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/czmq) -- High-level C binding for ÃMQ. (http://czmq.zeromq.org/)
    - **libzmq** [ð](./libzmq) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/libzmq) -- ZeroMQ core engine in C++, implements [ZMTP/3.1](https://zguide.zeromq.org/).


- **zpp_bits** [ð](./zpp_bits) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/zpp_bits) -- A modern, *fast*, C++20 binary serialization and RPC library, with just one header file.See also the [benchmark](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/zpp_bits#benchmark).

- ~~**FastBinaryEncoding** [ð](https://github.com/chronoxor/FastBinaryEncoding)~~
    - **removed**; reason: for binary format record serialization we will be using `bebop` exclusively. All other communications will be JSON/JSON5/XML based.


- ~~**flatbuffers** [ð](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers)~~
    - **removed**; reason: see `protobuf`: same smell rising. Faster at run time, but still a bit hairy to my tastes while `bebop` et al are on to something *potentially nice*.


- ~~**flatcc** [ð](https://github.com/dvidelabs/flatcc)~~
    - **removed**; reason: see `flatbuffers`. When we don't dig `flatbuffers`, then `flatcc` is automatically pretty useless to us. Let's rephrase that professionally: "`flatcc` has moved out of scope for our project."


- ~~**libsmile** [ð](https://github.com/pierre/libsmile) -- ["Smile" format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smile_%28data_interchange_format%29), i.e. a compact binary JSON format~~
    - **removed**; reason: for binary format record serialization we will be using `bebop` exclusively. All other communications will be JSON/JSON5/XML based.


- ~~**protobuf** [ð](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf)~~
    - **removed**; reason: relatively slow run-time and (in my opinion) rather ugly & convoluted approach at build time. Has too much of a Java/CorporateProgramming smell, which has not lessened over the years, unfortunately.




## IPC: websockets, etc.: all communication means

- **cpp-ipc** [ð](./cpp-ipc) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/cpp-ipc) -- a high-performance inter-process communication using shared memory on Linux/Windows.
- **cpp_rest_sdk**  [ð](./cpp_rest_sdk) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/cpprestsdk) -- C++ REST SDK is a Microsoft project for cloud-based client-server communication in native code using a modern asynchronous C++ API design. This project aims to help C++ developers connect to and interact with services.
- **cpp_rest_sdk** [ð](./cpp_rest_sdk) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/cpprestsdk) -- the C++ REST SDK is a Microsoft project for cloud-based client-server communication in native code using a modern asynchronous C++ API design. This project aims to help C++ developers connect to and interact with services.
- **crow** [ð](./crow) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/crow) -- IPC / server framework. Crow is a very fast and easy to use C++ micro web framework (inspired by Python Flask).

  Interface looks nicer than `oatpp`...

- **ecal** [ð](./ecal) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/ecal) -- the *enhanced Communication Abstraction Layer* (*eCAL*) is a middleware that enables scalable, high performance interprocess communication on a single computer node or between different nodes in a computer network. eCAL uses a publish-subscribe pattern to automatically connect different nodes in the network. eCAL automatically chooses the best available data transport mechanism for each link:

  - Shared memory for local communication (incredible fast!)
  - UDP for network communication

- **iceoryx** [ð](./iceoryx) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/iceoryx) -- true zero-copy inter-process-communication. iceoryx is an inter-process-communication (IPC) middleware for various operating systems (currently we support Linux, macOS, QNX, FreeBSD and Windows 10). It has its origins in the automotive industry, where large amounts of data have to be transferred between different processes when it comes to driver assistance or automated driving systems. However, the efficient communication mechanisms can also be applied to a wider range of use cases, e.g. in the field of robotics or game development.
- **libwebsocketpp** [ð](./libwebsocketpp) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/websocketpp) -- WebSocket++ is a header only C++ library that implements RFC6455 The WebSocket Protocol.
- **libwebsockets** [ð](./libwebsockets) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/libwebsockets) -- a simple-to-use C library providing client and server for HTTP/1, HTTP/2, WebSockets, MQTT and other protocols. It supports a lot of lightweight ancilliary implementations for things like JSON, CBOR, JOSE, COSE. It's very gregarious when it comes to event loop sharing, supporting libuv, libevent, libev, sdevent, glib and uloop, as well as custom event libs.

- **OpenSSL** [ð](./openssl) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/openssl) -- also used by cURL et al, incidentally.
- **restc-cpp** [ð](./restc-cpp) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/restc-cpp) -- a modern C++ REST Client library. The magic that takes the pain out of accessing JSON API's from C++. The design goal of this project is to make external REST API's simple and safe to use in C++ projects, but still fast and memory efficient.
- **tcp_pubsub** [ð](./tcp_pubsub) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/tcp_pubsub) -- a minimal publish-subscribe library that transports data via TCP. `tcp_pubsub` does not define a message format but only transports binary blobs. It does however define a protocol around that, which is kept as lightweight as possible.
- **userver** [ð](./userver) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/userver) -- an open source asynchronous framework with a rich set of abstractions for fast and comfortable creation of C++ microservices, services and utilities. The framework solves the problem of efficient I/O interactions transparently for the developers. Operations that would typically suspend the thread of execution do not suspend it. Instead of that, the thread processes other requests and tasks and returns to the handling of the operation only when it is guaranteed to execute immediately. As a result you get straightforward source code and avoid CPU-consuming context switches from OS, efficiently utilizing the CPU with a small amount of execution threads.
- **websocket-sharp** [ð](./websocket-sharp) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/websocket-sharp) -- a C# implementation of the WebSocket protocol client and server.
- **WinHttpPAL** [ð](./WinHttpPAL) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/WinHttpPAL) -- implements [WinHttp API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winhttp/winhttp-start-page) Platform Abstraction Layer for POSIX systems using libcurl

- ~~**ice** [ð](https://github.com/zeroc-ice/ice) -- Comprehensive RPC Framework: helps you network your software with minimal effort.~~
  - **removed**; reason: has a strong focus on the *remote*, i.e. `R` in `RPC` (thus a focus on things such as encryption, authentication, firewalling, etc.), which we don't want or need: all services are supposed to run on a single machine and comms go through `localhost` *only*. When folks find they need to distribute the workload across multiple machines, then we'll be entering a new era in Qiqqa usage and then will be soon enough to (re-)investigate the usefulness of this package.


Also, we are currently more interested in *fast data serialization* then RPC *per se* as we aim for a solution that's more akin to a REST API interface style.

- ~~**oatpp** [ð](https://github.com/oatpp/oatpp) -- IPC / server framework~~
  - **removed**; reason: see `crow`. We have picked `crow` as the preferred way forward, so any similar/competing product is out of scope unless `crow` throws a tantrum on our test bench after all, the chances of that being *very slim*.


### ZeroMQ a.k.a. ÃMQ

- **cppzmq** [ð](./cppzmq) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/cppzmq) -- header-only C++ binding for libzmq.
- **libCZMQ** [ð](./libCZMQ) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/czmq) -- High-level C binding for ÃMQ. (http://czmq.zeromq.org/)
- **libzmq** [ð](./libzmq) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/libzmq) -- ZeroMQ core engine in C++, implements [ZMTP/3.1](https://zguide.zeromq.org/).

### memory mapping

- **libmio** [ð](./libmio) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/mio) -- An easy to use header-only cross-platform C++11 memory mapping library. `mio` has been created with the goal to be easily includable (i.e. no dependencies) in any C++ project that needs memory mapped file IO without the need to pull in Boost.
- **libvrb** [ð](./libvrb) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/vrb) -- implements a ring buffer, also known as a character FIFO or circular buffer, with a special property that any data present in the buffer, as well as any empty space, are always seen as a single contiguous extent by the calling program.  This is implemented with virtual memory mapping by creating a mirror image of the buffer contents at the memory location in the virtual address space immediately after the main buffer location.  This allows the mirror image to always be seen without doing any copying of data.
- **portable-memory-mapping** [ð](./portable-memory-mapping) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/portable-memory-mapping) -- portable Memory Mapping C++ Class (Windows/Linux)



## IPC: JSON for protocol design

- **json** [ð](./json) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/nlohmann-json) -- N. Lohmann's JSON for Modern C++.
- **json-jansson** [ð](./json-jansson) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/jansson)
- **rapidJSON** [ð](./rapidJSON) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/rapidjson) -- TenCent's fast JSON parser/generator for C++ with both SAX & DOM style APIs.
- **yyjson** [ð](./yyjson) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/yyjson) -- allegedly the fastest JSON library in C.
- ~~**libsmile** [ð](https://github.com/pierre/libsmile) -- ["Smile" format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smile_%28data_interchange_format%29), i.e. a compact binary JSON format~~
  - **removed**; reason: I think we'd better standardize on using one or more of these:
    - custom binary exchange formats for those interchanges that demand highest performance and MAY carry large transfer loads.
    - JSON
    - TOML
    - XML
    - YAML


## ~~IPC: YAML, TOML, etc. for protocol design~~

**Not considered**: reason: when we want the IPC protocol to be "human readable" in any form/approximation, we've decided to stick with JSON or XML (if we cannot help it -- I particularly dislike the verbosity and tag redundancy (open+close) in XML and consider it a lousy design choice for *any* purpose).

The more human readable formats (YAML, TOML, ...) are intended for human to machine communications, e.g. for feeding configurations into applications, and **SHOULD NOT** be used for IPC anywhere. (Though I must say I'm on the fence where it comes using YAML as an alternative IPC format where it replaces JSON; another contender there are the JSON5/JSON6 formats.)


## Content Hashing (cryptographic strength i.e. *"guaranteed"* collision-free)

The bit about **_"guaranteed"_ collision-free** is to be read as: hash algorithms in this section must come with *strong statistical guarantees* that any chance at a **hash collision** is negligible, even for *extremely large* collections. In practice this means: use *cryptographic* hash algorithms with a *strength* of 128 bits or more. (Qiqqa used a b0rked version SHA1 thus far, which is considered too weak as we already sample PDFs which cause a hash collision for the *official* SHA1 algo (and thus also collide in our b0rked SHA1 variant): while those can still be argued to be fringe case, I don't want to be bothered with this at all and thus choose to err on the side of 'better than SHA1B' here. Meanwhile, any library in here *may* contain weaker cryptographic hashes alongside: we won't be using those for **content hashing**.

- **BLAKE3** [ð](./BLAKE3) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/BLAKE3) -- cryptographic hash
- **cryptopp** [ð](./cryptopp) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/cryptopp) -- crypto library
- **OpenSSL** [ð](./openssl) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/openssl) -- its crypto library part, more specifically.
- **tink** [ð](./tink) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/tink) -- A multi-language, cross-platform library that provides cryptographic APIs that are secure, easy to use correctly, and hard(er) to misuse.


## Hash-like Filters & Fast Hashing for Hash Tables et al (64 bits and less, mostly)

These hashes are for other purposes, e.g. fast lookup in dictionaries, fast approximate hit testing and set reduction through fast filtering (think *bloom filter*). These *may* be **machine specific** (and some of them *are*): these are **never supposed to be used for encoding in storage or other means which crosses machine boundaries**: if you want to use them for a database index, that is fine *as long as* you don't expect that database index to be readable by any other machine than the one which produced and uses these hash numbers.

> As you can see from the list below, I went on a shopping spree, having fun with all the latest, including some *possibly insane* stuff that's only really useful for particular edge cases -- which we *hope to avoid ourselves, for a while at least*. Anyway, I'ld say we've got the motherlode here. Simple fun for those days when your brain-flag is at half-mast. Enjoy.

- **BBHash** [ð](./BBHash) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/BBHash) -- Bloom-filter based minimal perfect hash function library.
- **BCF-cuckoo-index** [ð](./BCF-cuckoo-index) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/BCF) -- Better Choice Cuckoo Filter (BCF) is an efficient approximate set representation data structure. Different from the standard Cuckoo Filter (CF), BCF leverages the principle of the power of two choices to select the better candidate bucket during insertion.

Unfortunately, they can use too much memory. To compensate, we often use compressed bitmaps. Roaring bitmaps are compressed bitmaps which tend to outperform conventional compressed bitmaps such as WAH, EWAH or Concise. They are used by several major systems such as Apache Lucene and derivative systems such as Solr and Elasticsearch, etc.. The CRoaring library is used in several systems such as Apache Doris.

- **cuckoo-index** [ð](./cuckoo-index) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/cuckoo-index) -- Cuckoo Index (CI) is a lightweight secondary index structure that represents the many-to-many relationship between keys and partitions of columns in a highly space-efficient way. CI associates variable-sized fingerprints in a Cuckoo filter with compressed bitmaps indicating qualifying partitions. The problem of finding all partitions that possibly contain a given lookup key is traditionally solved by maintaining one filter (e.g., a Bloom filter) per partition that indexes all unique key values contained in this partition. To identify all partitions containing a key, we would need to probe all per-partition filters (which could be many). Depending on the storage medium, a false positive there can be very expensive. Furthermore, secondary columns typically contain many duplicates (also across partitions). Cuckoo Index (CI) addresses these drawbacks of per-partition filters. (It must know all keys at build time, though.)
- **DCF-cuckoo-index** [ð](./DCF-cuckoo-index) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/DCF) -- the Dynamic Cuckoo Filter (DCF) is an efficient approximate membership test data structure. Different from the classic Bloom filter and its variants, DCF is especially designed for highly dynamic datasets and supports extending and reducing its capacity. The DCF design is the first to achieve both reliable item deletion and flexibly extending/reducing for approximate set representation and membership testing. DCF outperforms the state-of-the-art DBF designs in both speed and memory consumption.

It is a cache-friendly data structure offering better performances than `std::unordered_map` in most cases and is closely similar to `google::dense_hash_map` while using less memory and providing more functionalities.
- **LDCF-hash** [ð](./LDCF-hash) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/LDCF) -- The Logarithmic Dynamic Cuckoo Filter (LDCF) is an efficient approximate membership test data structure for dynamic big data sets. LDCF uses a novel multi-level tree structure and reduces the worst insertion and membership testing time from O(N) to O(1), while simultaneously reducing the memory cost of DCF as the cardinality of the set increases.
- **libbloom** [ð](./libbloom) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/bloomd) -- a high-performance C server, exposing bloom filters and operations over them.

- **morton_filter** [ð](./morton_filter) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/morton_filter) -- a [Morton filter](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol11/p1041-breslow.pdf) -- a new approximate set membership data structure. A Morton filter is a modified cuckoo filter that is optimized for bandwidth-constrained systems. Morton filters use additional computation in order to reduce their off-chip memory traffic. Like a cuckoo filter, a Morton filter supports insertions, deletions, and lookup operations. It additionally adds high-throughput self-resizing, a feature of quotient filters, which allows a Morton filter to increase its capacity solely by leveraging its internal representation. This capability is in contrast to existing vanilla cuckoo filter implementations, which are static and thus require using a backing data structure that contains the full set of items to resize the filter. Morton filters can also be configured to use less memory than a cuckoo filter for the same error rate while simultaneously delivering insertion, deletion, and lookup throughputs that are, respectively, up to 15.5x, 1.3x, and 2.5x higher than a cuckoo filter. Morton filters in contrast to vanilla cuckoo filters do not require a power of two number of buckets but rather only a number that is a multiple of two. They also use fewer bits per item than a Bloom filter when the target false positive rate is less than around 1% to 3%.
- **phf-hash** [ð](./phf-hash) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/phf) -- a simple implementation of the CHD perfect hash algorithm. CHD can generate perfect hash functions for very large key sets -- on the order of millions of keys -- in a very short time.

- **lmdb-safe** [ð](./lmdb-safe) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/lmdb-safe) -- A safe modern & performant C++ wrapper of LMDB. LMDB is an outrageously fast key/value store with semantics that make it highly interesting for many applications. Of specific note, besides speed, is the full support for transactions and good read/write concurrency. LMDB is also famed for its robustness.. **when used correctly**. The design of LMDB is elegant and simple, which aids both the performance and stability. The downside of this elegant design is a nontrivial set of rules that need to be followed to not break things. In other words, LMDB delivers great things but only if you use it exactly right. This is by conscious design. The `lmdb-safe` library aims to deliver the full LMDB performance while programmatically making sure the LMDB semantics are adhered to, with very limited overhead.

- **librsync** [ð](./librsync) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/librsync) -- a library for calculating and applying network deltas. librsync encapsulates the core algorithms of the rsync protocol, which help with efficient calculation of the differences between two files. The rsync algorithm is different from most differencing algorithms because it does not require the presence of the two files to calculate the delta.  Instead, it requires a set of checksums of each block of one file, which together form a signature for that file.  Blocks at any position in the other file which have the same checksum are likely to be identical, and whatever remains is the difference. This algorithm transfers the differences between two files without needing both files on the same system.
- **zsync2** [ð](./zsync2) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/zsync2) -- the advanced file download/sync tool zsync. zsync is a well known tool for downloading and updating local files from HTTP servers using the well known algorithms rsync used for diffing binary files. Therefore, it becomes possible to synchronize modifications by exchanging the changed blocks locally using `Range:` requests. The system is based on meta files called `.zsync` files. They contain hash sums for every block of data. The file is generated from and stored along with the actual file it refers to. Due to how system works, nothing but a "dumb" HTTP server is required to make use of zsync2. This makes it easy to integrate zsync2 into existing systems.

Finite-state acceptors are used to represent sets of strings (specifically, regular or rational sets); finite-state transducers are used to represent binary relations between pairs of strings (specifically, rational transductions). The weights can be used to represent the cost of taking a particular transition. FSTs have key applications in speech recognition and synthesis, machine translation, optical character recognition, pattern matching, string processing, machine learning, information extraction and retrieval among others. Often a weighted transducer is used to represent a probabilistic model (e.g., an n-gram model, pronunciation model). FSTs can be optimized by determinization and minimization, models can be applied to hypothesis sets (also represented as automata) or cascaded by finite-state composition, and the best results can be selected by shortest-path algorithms.

## FTS (*Full Text Search*) and related: SOLR/Lucene et al: document content search

We'll be using SOLR mostly, but here might be some interface libraries and an intersting alternative

- [Manticore](https://manticoresearch.com/) -- while the userbase is much smaller than for the *Lucene Gang* (Lucene/SOLR/ES/OpenSearch), this still got me. Can't say exactly why. All the other Lucene/SOLR alternatives out there didn't appeal to me (old tech, slow dev, ...).

- **pisa** [ð](./pisa) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/pisa) -- a text search engine able to run on large-scale collections of documents. It allows researchers to experiment with state-of-the-art techniques, allowing an ideal environment for rapid development. PISA is a text search engine, though the "PISA Project" is a set of tools that help experiment with indexing and query processing. Given a text collection, PISA can build an inverted index over this corpus, allowing the corpus to be searched. The inverted index, put simply, is an efficient data structure that represents the document corpus by storing a list of documents for each unique term (see here). At query time, PISA stores its index in main memory for rapid retrieval.
- **typesense** [ð](./typesense) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/typesense) -- a fast, typo-tolerant search engine for building delightful search experiences.

### language detection / inference

- **cld2-language-detect** [ð](./cld2-language-detect) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/cld2) -- CLD2 probabilistically detects over 80 languages in Unicode UTF-8 text, either plain text or HTML/XML. For mixed-language input, CLD2 returns the top three languages found and their approximate percentages of the total text bytes.  Optionally, it also returns a vector of text spans with the language of each identified. The design target is web pages of at least 200 characters (about two sentences); CLD2 is not designed to do well on very short text.
- **uchardet** [ð](./uchardet) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/uchardet) -- [uchardet](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/uchardet/) is an encoding and language detector library, which attempts to determine the encoding of the text.

  - **removed**; reason: we've decided to offer any application user facing scripting features in JavaScript only: Python and the others can use socket-based messaging when someone wants to write their user scripts in any of those languages.


The additional (and more important) reason to ditch CPython from the R&D set is hairiness of integrating Python into an application as an embedded scripting language, instead of the other way around. With the envisioned advent of ZeroMQ/socket based IPC, any Python scripts can hook into that instead of spending the effort and maintenance of having that large language as an embedded 'assistive' scripting/configuration language: it's simply too huge and complicated. We're not Blender and we don't have the funding.

### misc. core functionality

- **coost** [ð](./coost) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/coost) -- A tiny boost library in C++11. `coost` (formerly known as `cocoyaxi`) is an elegant and efficient cross-platform C++ base library, it is not as heavy as `boost`, but still provides enough powerful features.
- **delegate** [ð](./delegate) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/delegate) -- an embedded friendly alternative to `std::function`. The main purpose is to store callable things such as free functions, member functions, and functors. Once stored, the delegate can be called without knowledge of the type of stored thing. The `delegate` guarantees no heap allocation and [is `trivially_copyable`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/TriviallyCopyable). It will never throw exceptions itself. Intended use is as general callback storage (think function pointer analog). The price to pay is that the delegate only stores a pointer to referenced functor objects or objects to call member functions on. The user needs to handle the lifetime of a referred object. In addition, the delegation object has a smaller footprint compared to common `std::function` implementations, using only 2 pointers (free function pointer and void pointer). This is small enough so that a delegate will use small object optimization.

### multi-processing: Promise/A+

The key distinction between Promises/A+ and `std::promise` in C++11 is that Promises/A+ provides non-blocking synchronization (via chaining function objects) and `std::promise` provides blocking synchronization (or polling). Both have their uses and one is not a direct replacement for the other.

IMPORTANT NOTE: there is one major difference, though. Most modern Javascript promises (including JS Native promises) resolve asynchronously, i.e. their `resolve()` method does not directly call the `then()` handlers, but schedules the calls on the next message loop iteration. The same happens when a `then()`/`catch()` handler is attached to an already resolved/rejected promise. This may be a bit less efficient, but makes the behavior symmetric and more predictable. These libraries *SHOULD* resolve synchronously, because they are unaware of the message loop that is used in the application. (Look into task schedulers above for when you need such awareness, e.g. `taskflow`.)

- **asynqro** [ð](./asynqro) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/asynqro) -- Futures and thread pool for C++: Asynqro gives developers a rich monadic Future API (inspired by Future API in Scala language), a clean API, refined task scheduling logic and is not tied to any framework.

### multi-processing: running tasks in parallel: multi-processing, multithreading, async, ...

- **createprocess-windows** [ð](./createprocess-windows) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/createprocess-windows) -- drive `CreateProcess` Win32 API
- **libaco** [ð](./libaco) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/libaco) --  a blazing fast and lightweight C asymmetric coroutine library ð âðâð Along with the implementation of a production-ready C coroutine library, it has detailed documentation about how to implement a fastest and correct coroutine library, includes a strict mathematical proof. It has no more than 700 LOC but has the full functionality which you may want from a coroutine library. (The phrase "fastest" here means the fastest context switching implementation which complies to the Sys V ABI of Intel386 or AMD64.)
- **libcopp** [ð](./libcopp) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/libcopp) -- cross-platform coroutine library in C++
- **libcsp** [ð](./libcsp) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/libcsp) -- a concurrency C library 10x faster than Golang, influenced by the CSP model.
- **libtuv** [ð](./libtuv) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/libtuv) -- a multi-platform tiny event library refactored from `libuv` source for IoT and embedded systems.

This project contains implementations of the following: Schedulers, Timers, Asynchronous I/O, Algorithms that encapsulate certain concurrency patterns, Async streams, Cancellation, Coroutine integration.
- **nsync** [ð](./nsync) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/nsync) -- a C library that exports various synchronization primitives. `nsync` may be desirable in place of `pthread` primitives in some cases:  (1) nsync locks are reader-writer locks (but are as efficient as mutexes).  (2) nsync locks and condition variables occupy only two words each.  (3) nsync works on Unix-like systems and Windows.  It should be portable to other platforms straightforwardly.  (4) nsync provides conditional critical sections.  These fill the same role as condition variables, but are usually easier to use, and in most common cases are comparable in speed.  They can be easier to use in two ways:  (A) it's not necessary to surround the "wait" operation in a while loop; instead the condition is passed to the call as a function and arbitrary pointer argument.  (B) it's not necessary to wake or signal explicitly when the condition(s) become true; they are checked automatically. The primary downsides are:  (A) they are not available in most other common synchronization APIs, and so they may be unfamiliar (even though they date back to the 1960s), and (B) if threads routinely wait on many distinct, false conditions associated with the same lock, they may be slower than condition variables. In this case, clients can use condition variables in the normal way; conditional critical sections and condition variables can be used with the same lock.  (5) nsync waits can be cancelled via an object passed to the wait calls, unlike the pthread model in which threads are cancelled.  This difference can be useful if the computation needs multiple threads, or if cancellation affects only sub-operations within a larger operation by the thread.
- **oneTBB** [ð](./oneTBB) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/oneTBB) -- Intel's Thread Building Blocks library: used with OpenImageIO, ...
- **pevents** [ð](./pevents) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/pevents) -- Win32 events for *nix/POSIX platforms, built on top of `pthreads`. `pevents` provides most of the functionality of both manual- and auto-reset events on Windows, most-notably including simultaneous waits on multiple events (Ã  la `WaitForMultipleObjects`). `pevents` also doubles as a thin, sane wrapper for `CreateEvent()` & co. on Windows, meaning you can use `pevents` directly in your cross-platform code without `#ifdef`s for Windows/pthreads. While POSIX condition variables (pthread_cond_t) and WIN32 events both provide the essential building blocks of the synchronization primitives required to write multithreaded code with signaling, the nature of the differences between the two have lent their way towards creating different synchronization and multithreaded-programming paradigms. The only features not included are only named events and support for security attributes. To the author's best knowledge, this is the only implementation of WIN32 events available for Linux and other posix platforms that provides support for simultaneously waiting on multiple events. Depending on your needs, we've been told that pevents may be used as a lightweight alternative to libuv/libev while still allowing your code to embrace asynchronous event handling with ease.
- **PhotonLibOS** [ð](./PhotonLibOS) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/PhotonLibOS) -- a high-efficiency LibOS framework, based on a set of carefully selected C++ libs. The role of LibOS is to connect user apps and the kernel. Photon's API is as consistent as possible with C++ std and glibc semantics. This flattens the learning curve for lib users and brings convenience when migrating legacy codebases. Photon's runtime is driven by a coroutine lib. Out tests show that it has the best I/O performance in the open source world by the year of 2022, even among different programing languages.

  Features:
    - Braided parallelism - can issue tasks from another task as well as from the thread which created the Task System, and has a simple task interface for both data and task parallelism.
    - Can pin tasks to a given thread - can schedule a task which will only be run on the specified thread.
    - Can register external threads to use with enkiTS
    - Can set task priorities - Up to 5 task priorities can be configured via define ENKITS_TASK_PRIORITIES_NUM (defaults to 3). Higher priority tasks are run before lower priority ones.
    - Can wait for pinned tasks - useful for creating IO threads which do no other work.
    - Completion Actions - can perform an action on task completion. This avoids the expensive action of adding the task to the scheduler, and can be used to safely delete a completed task.
    - Dependencies - can set dependencies between tasks.
    - Fast, then scalable - designed for consumer devices first, so performance on a low number of threads is important, followed by scalability.
    - Lightweight
    - Up-front Allocation friendly - designed for zero allocations during scheduling.

- ~~**zlog** [ð](https://github.com/HardySimpson/zlog)~~
  - **removed**; `zlog` has a nice overall design but is too 'Unix-is-the-world' in its coding: in the end it was easy of cross-platform compilation of `glog` that won the day and I'm okay with layering on top of that one to get the zlog category and other channel features, once I really need them.

- **annoy** [ð](./annoy) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/annoy) -- ANNOY (<b>A</b>pproximate <b>N</b>earest <b>N</b>eighbors <b>O</b>h <b>Y</b>eah) is a C++ library to search for points in space that are close to a given query point. It also creates large read-only file-based data structures that are `mmap`-ped into memory so that many processes may share the same data. ANNOY is almost as fast as the fastest libraries, but what really sets Annoy apart is: it has the ability to use static files as indexes, enabling you to share an index across processes. ANNOY also decouples creating indexes from loading them, so you can pass around indexes as files and map them into memory quickly. ANNOY tries to minimize its memory footprint: the indexes are quite small. This is useful when you want to find nearest neighbors using multiple CPU's. Spotify uses ANNOY for music recommendations.

- **cuckoo-index** [ð](./cuckoo-index) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/cuckoo-index) -- Cuckoo Index (CI) is a lightweight secondary index structure that represents the many-to-many relationship between keys and partitions of columns in a highly space-efficient way. CI associates variable-sized fingerprints in a Cuckoo filter with compressed bitmaps indicating qualifying partitions. The problem of finding all partitions that possibly contain a given lookup key is traditionally solved by maintaining one filter (e.g., a Bloom filter) per partition that indexes all unique key values contained in this partition. To identify all partitions containing a key, we would need to probe all per-partition filters (which could be many). Depending on the storage medium, a false positive there can be very expensive. Furthermore, secondary columns typically contain many duplicates (also across partitions). Cuckoo Index (CI) addresses these drawbacks of per-partition filters.

- **delegate** [ð](./delegate) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/delegate) -- an embedded friendly alternative to `std::function`. The main purpose is to store callable things such as free functions, member functions, and functors. Once stored, the delegate can be called without knowledge of the type of stored thing. The `delegate` guarantees no heap allocation and [is `trivially_copyable`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/TriviallyCopyable). It will never throw exceptions itself. Intended use is as general callback storage (think function pointer analog). The price to pay is that the delegate only stores a pointer to referenced functor objects or objects to call member functions on. The user needs to handle the lifetime of a referred object. In addition, the delegation object has a smaller footprint compared to common `std::function` implementations, using only 2 pointers (free function pointer and void pointer). This is small enough so that a delegate will use small object optimization.

A Morton filter is a modified cuckoo filter that is optimized for bandwidth-constrained systems. Morton filters use additional computation in order to reduce their off-chip memory traffic. Like a cuckoo filter, a Morton filter supports insertions, deletions, and lookup operations. It additionally adds high-throughput self-resizing, a feature of quotient filters, which allows a Morton filter to increase its capacity solely by leveraging its internal representation. This capability is in contrast to existing vanilla cuckoo filter implementations, which are static and thus require using a backing data structure that contains the full set of items to resize the filter. Morton filters can also be configured to use less memory than a cuckoo filter for the same error rate while simultaneously delivering insertion, deletion, and lookup throughputs that are, respectively, up to 15.5x, 1.3x, and 2.5x higher than a cuckoo filter. Morton filters in contrast to vanilla cuckoo filters do not require a power of two number of buckets but rather only a number that is a multiple of two. They also use fewer bits per item than a Bloom filter when the target false positive rate is less than around 1% to 3%.

- **nsync** [ð](./nsync) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/nsync) -- a C library that exports various synchronization primitives. `nsync` may be desirable in place of `pthread` primitives in some cases:  (1) nsync locks are reader-writer locks (but are as efficient as mutexes).  (2) nsync locks and condition variables occupy only two words each.  (3) nsync works on Unix-like systems and Windows.  It should be portable to other platforms straightforwardly.  (4) nsync provides conditional critical sections.  These fill the same role as condition variables, but are usually easier to use, and in most common cases are comparable in speed.  They can be easier to use in two ways:  (A) it's not necessary to surround the "wait" operation in a while loop; instead the condition is passed to the call as a function and arbitrary pointer argument.  (B) it's not necessary to wake or signal explicitly when the condition(s) become true; they are checked automatically. The primary downsides are:  (A) they are not available in most other common synchronization APIs, and so they may be unfamiliar (even though they date back to the 1960s), and (B) if threads routinely wait on many distinct, false conditions associated with the same lock, they may be slower than condition variables. In this case, clients can use condition variables in the normal way; conditional critical sections and condition variables can be used with the same lock.  (5) nsync waits can be cancelled via an object passed to the wait calls, unlike the pthread model in which threads are cancelled.  This difference can be useful if the computation needs multiple threads, or if cancellation affects only sub-operations within a larger operation by the thread.

- **OpenFST** [ð](./OpenFST) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/openfst) -- a library for constructing, combining, optimizing, and searching weighted finite-state transducers (FSTs). Weighted finite-state transducers are automata where each transition has an input label, an output label, and a weight. The more familiar finite-state acceptor is represented as a transducer with each transition's input and output label equal. Finite-state acceptors are used to represent sets of strings (specifically, regular or rational sets); finite-state transducers are used to represent binary relations between pairs of strings (specifically, rational transductions). The weights can be used to represent the cost of taking a particular transition. FSTs have key applications in speech recognition and synthesis, machine translation, optical character recognition, pattern matching, string processing, machine learning, information extraction and retrieval among others. Often a weighted transducer is used to represent a probabilistic model (e.g., an n-gram model, pronunciation model). FSTs can be optimized by determinization and minimization, models can be applied to hypothesis sets (also represented as automata) or cascaded by finite-state composition, and the best results can be selected by shortest-path algorithms.

- **pevents** [ð](./pevents) [ð](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/pevents) -- Win32 events for *nix/POSIX platforms, built on top of `pthreads`. `pevents` provides most of the functionality of both manual- and auto-reset events on Windows, most-notably including simultaneous waits on multiple events (Ã  la `WaitForMultipleObjects`). `pevents` also doubles as a thin, sane wrapper for `CreateEvent()` & co. on Windows, meaning you can use `pevents` directly in your cross-platform code without `#ifdef`s for Windows/pthreads. While POSIX condition variables (pthread_cond_t) and WIN32 events both provide the essential building blocks of the synchronization primitives required to write multithreaded code with signaling, the nature of the differences between the two have lent their way towards creating different synchronization and multithreaded-programming paradigms. The only features not included are only named events and support for security attributes. To the author's best knowledge, this is the only implementation of WIN32 events available for Linux and other posix platforms that provides support for simultaneously waiting on multiple events. Depending on your needs, we've been told that pevents may be used as a lightweight alternative to libuv/libev while still allowing your code to embrace asynchronous event handling with ease.
