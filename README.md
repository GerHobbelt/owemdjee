<!-- 📁🌐 force Notepad++ to recognize UTF8: 📁🌐 -->

Data Science & Image Processing amalgam library in C/C++.

This place is a gathering spot & integration workplace for the C & C++ libraries we choose to use.  Think "*Façade Pattern*" and you're getting warm. 😉
The heavy data lifting will be done in the referenced libraries, while this lib will provide some glue and common ground for them to work in/with.
