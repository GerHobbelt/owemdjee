# owemdjee

Data Science & Image Processing amalgam library in C/C++.

This place is a gathering spot & integration workplace for the C & C++ libraries we choose to use.  Think "*Façade Pattern*" and you're getting warm. 😉
The heavy data lifting will be done in the referenced libraries, while this lib will provide some glue and common ground for them to work in/with.

## Reason for this repo

`git submodules` hasn't been the most, ah, "user-friendly" methods to track and manage a set of libraries that you wish to track at *source level*.

A few problems have been repeatedly observed over our lifetime with `git`:

+ when it so happens that the importance & interest in a submoduled library is perhaps waning and you want to migrate to another, you can of course invoke `git` to ditch the old sow and bring in the shiny new one, but that stuff gets quite finicky when you are pedalling back & forth through your commit tree when, e.g. bughunting or maintenance work on a release branch which isn't up to snuff with the fashion kids yet.

  Yup, that's been much less of a problem since about 2018, but old scars need more than a pat on the arm to heal, if you get my drift.

+ folks haven't always been the happy campers they were supposed to be when they're facing a set of submodules and want to feel safe and sure in their "knowledge" that each library X is at commit Y, when the top of the module tree is itself at commit Z, for we are busy producing a production release, perhaps? That's a wee bit stressful and there have been enough "flukes" with git to make that a not-so-ironclad-as-we-would-like position.

  Over time, [I've created several bash shell scripts to help with that buzzin' feelin' of *absolute certainty*](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/developer-utility-commands). Useful perhaps, but the cuteness of those wears off pretty darn quickly when many nodes in the submodule tree start cluttering their git repo with those.











### And?

This repo is made to ensure we have a single point of reference for all the data munching stuff, at least.

We don't need to `git submodule add` all those data processing libs in our applications this way, as this is a single submodule to bother that project with. The scripts and other material in here will provide the means to ensure your build and test tools can quickly and easily ensure that everyone in here is at the commit spot they're supposed to be.

And when we want to add another lib about data/image processing, we do that in here, so the application-level git repo sees a very stable singular submodule all the time: this repo/lib, not the stuff that will change over time as external libs gain and loose momentum over time. (We're talking multiyear timespans here!)











### Critique?

It's not the most brilliant solution to our problems, as this, of course, becomes a single point of failure that way, but experience in the past with similar "solutions" has shown that it's maybe not always fun, but at least we keep track of the management crap in one place and that was worth it, every time.

And why not do away with `git submodule` entirely and use packages instead? Because this stuff is important enough that *other, quite painful experience* has shown us that (binary & source) packages are a wonder and a hassle too: I'ld rather have my code tracked and tagged at source level **all the way** because that has reduced several bug situations from man-*weeks* to man-*hours*: like Gentoo, compile it all, one compiler only.  Doesn't matter if the bug is in your own code or elsewhere, there are enough moments like that where one is helped enormously by the ability to step through *and possibly tweak a bit of code here or there temporarily to help the debugging process* that I, at least, prefer full source code.

And that's what this repo is here to provide: the source code gathered and ready for use on our machines.











### Why is this repo a *solution*? And does it scale?

The worst bit first: it scales like rotten eggs. The problem there is two-fold: first, there's (relatively) few people who want to track progress at the bleeding edge, so tooling is consequently limited in power and availability, compared to conservative approaches (count the number of *package managers* lately?).

Meanwhile, I'm in a spot where I *want* to ride the bleeding edge, at least most of the time, and I happen to *like* it that way: my world is much more *R&D* than *product maintenance*, so having a means to track, relatively easy, the latest developments in subjects and materiel of interest is a boon to me. Sure, I'll moan and rant about it once in a while, but if I wanted to really get rid of the need to be flexible and *adapt to changes*, sometimes often, I'ld have gone with the conservative stability of *package managers* and *LTS releases* already. Which I've done for other parts of my environment, but do not intend to do for the part which is largely covered by this repo: source libraries which I intend to use or am using already in research tools I'm developing for others and myself.

For that purpose, this repo is a *solution*, though -- granted -- a *sub-optimal one* in that it doesn't scale very well. I don't think there's any automated process available to make this **significantly faster and more scalable** anyway: the fact that I'm riding the bleeding edge and wish to be able to backpedal at will when the latest change of direction or state of affairs of a component is off the rails (from my perspective at least), requires me to be flexible and adaptable to the full gamut of change. There are alternative approaches, also within the `git` world, but they haven't shown real appeal vs. *old skool* `git submodules` -- which is cranky at times and a pain in the neck when you want to ditch something but still need it in another dev branch, *moan moan moan*, but anyway... -- so here we are.

> **Side note**: submodules which have been picked up for experimentation and inspection **but have been deleted from this A list later on** are ~~struck through~~ in the overview below: the rationale there is that we can thus still observe **why** we struck it off the list, *plus* never make the mistake of re-introducing it after a long time, forgetting that we once had a look already, *without* running into the struck-through entry and having to re-evaluate the reason at least, before we re-introduce an item.

# Intent

<!--```toc
```-->

* [TOC](#intent)
    * [Inter-process communications (IPC)](#inter-process-communications-ipc)
    * [Programming Languages used: *intent and purposes*](#programming-languages-used-intent-and-purposes)
    * [Scripting the System: Languages Considered for Scripting by Users](#scripting-the-system-languages-considered-for-scripting-by-users)











## Inter-process communications (IPC)

Lowest possible **run-time** cost, a.k.a. "run-time overhead": the aim is to have IPC which does not noticably impact UX (User Experience of the application: responsiveness / UI) on reeasonably powered machines. (Users are *not* expected to have the latest or fastest hardware.)

As *at least* large images will be transfered (PDF page renders) we need to have a binary-able protocol.











## Programming Languages used: *intent and purposes*

We expect to use these languages in processes which require this type of IPC:

- C / C++ (**backend No.1**)
  + PDF renderer ([mupdf](https://mupdf.com/))
  + metadata & annotations extractor ([mupdf](https://mupdf.com/) et al)
  + *very* probably also the database interface (SQLite)
  + \[page] image processing (leptonica, openCV, ImageMagick?, what-ever turns out to be useful and reasonable to integrate (particularly between PDF page renderer and OCR engine to help us provide a *user-tunable* PDF text+metadata extractor
  + OCR (tesseract)
  + "A.I."-assisted tooling to help process and *clean* PDFs: cover pages, abstract/summary extraction for meta-research, etc. (think ngrams, xdelta, SVM, tensors, author identification, document categorization, document similarity / \[*near*-]duplicate / revision detection, tagging, ...)
  + document identifier key generator a.k.a. **content hasher** for creating **unique** key for each document, which can be used as database record index, etc.
    * old: Qiqqa SHA1B
    * new: BLAKE3+Base36

- C# (**"business logic" / "middleware"**: the glue logic)
- Java (SOLR / Lucene: our choice for the "full text search database" ~ **backend No.2**)
- JavaScript (**UI**, mostly. Think [*electron*](https://www.electronjs.org/), *web browser*, [*Chromely*](https://chromely.net/)<sup>[also](https://github.com/chromelyapps/Chromely)</sup>, [*WebView2*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/)<sup>[plus](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/)</sup>, that sort of thing)

Here we *intend* to use the regular SOLR APIs, which does not require specialized binary IPC.

We **may** **probably** choose to use a web-centric UI approach where images are *compressed* and *cached* in the *backend*, while being provided as \<picture> or \<img> tag references (URLs) in the HTML generated by the backend. *However*, we keep our options open ATM as furtheer testing is expected to hit a few obstacles there (smart caching required as we will be processing lots of documents in "background **bulk processes**" alongside the browsing and other more *direct* user activity) so a *websocket* or similar push technology may be employed: there we may benefit from dedicated IPC for large binary and text data transfers.











## Scripting the System: Languages Considered for Scripting by Users

Python has been considered. Given its loud presence in the AI communities, we still may integrate it one day. However, personally I'm not a big fan of the language and don't use it unless it's *prudent to do*, e.g. when extending or tweaking previous works produced by others.
Also, it turns out, it's not exactly *easy* to integrate (CPython) and I don't see a need for it beyond this one project / product: Qiqqa.

I've looked at Lua for a scripting language suitable for users (used quite a lot in the gaming industries and elsewhere); initial trials to get something going did not uncover major obstacles, but the question "_how do I **debug** Lua scripts?_" does not produce any viable project / product that goes beyond the *old skool `printf`-style debugging method*. Not a prime candidate therefor, as we expect that users will pick this up, when they like it, and grow the user scripts to unanticipated size and complexity: I've seen this happen multiple times in my career. Lua does not provide a scalable growth path from my perspective due to the lack of a *decent, customizable, debugger*.

Third candidate is JavaScript. While Artifex/mupdf comes with `mujs`, which is a simple engine it suffers from *two* drawbacks: it's ES5 and also does not provide a debugger mechanism beyond old skool `print`. Nice for nerds, but this is user-facing and thus not a viable option.

The other JavaScript engines considered are of varying size, performance and complexity. *Some* of them offer ways to integrate them with the \[F12] Chrome browser Developer Tools debugger, which would be *very nice to have available*. The road traveled there, along the various JavaScript engines is this:

- **cel-cpp** [📁](./cel-cpp) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/cel-cpp) -- C++ Implementations of the Common Expression Language. For background on the Common Expression Language see the cel-spec repo. Common Expression Language specification: the Common Expression Language (CEL) implements common semantics for expression evaluation, enabling different applications to more easily interoperate. Key Applications are (1) Security policy: organizations have complex infrastructure and need common tooling to reason about the system as a whole and (2) Protocols: expressions are a useful data type and require interoperability across programming languages and platforms.
- **cel-spec** [📁](./cel-spec) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/cel-spec) -- Common Expression Language specification: the Common Expression Language (CEL) implements common semantics for expression evaluation, enabling different applications to more easily interoperate. Key Applications are (1) Security policy: organizations have complex infrastructure and need common tooling to reason about the system as a whole and (2) Protocols: expressions are a useful data type and require interoperability across programming languages and platforms.
- **chibi-scheme** [📁](./chibi-scheme) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/chibi-scheme) -- Chibi-Scheme is a very small library intended for use as an extension and scripting language in C programs.  In addition to support for lightweight VM-based threads, each VM itself runs in an isolated heap allowing multiple VMs to run simultaneously in different OS threads.
- **guile** [📁](./guile) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/guile) -- Guile is Project GNU's extension language library. Guile is an implementation of the Scheme programming language, packaged as a library that can be linked into applications to give them their own extension language.  Guile supports other languages as well, giving users of Guile-based applications a choice of languages.
- **itcl** [📁](./itcl) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/itcl) -- Itcl is an object oriented extension for Tcl.
- **jimtcl** [📁](./jimtcl) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/jimtcl) -- the Jim Interpreter is a small-footprint implementation of the Tcl programming language written from scratch. Currently Jim Tcl is very feature complete with an extensive test suite (see the tests directory). There are some Tcl commands and features which are not implemented (and likely never will be), including traces and Tk. However, Jim Tcl offers a number of both Tcl8.5 and Tcl8.6 features ({*}, dict, lassign, tailcall and optional UTF-8 support) and some unique features. These unique features include [lambda] with garbage collection, a general GC/references system, arrays as syntax sugar for [dict]tionaries, object-based I/O and more. Other common features of the Tcl programming language are present, like the "everything is a string" behaviour, implemented internally as dual ported objects to ensure that the execution time does not reflect the semantic of the language :)
- **newlisp** [📁](./newlisp) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/newlisp) -- newLISP is a LISP-like scripting language for doing things you typically do with scripting languages: programming for the internet, system administration, text processing, gluing other programs together, etc. newLISP is a scripting LISP for people who are fascinated by LISP's beauty and power of expression, but who need it stripped down to easy-to-learn essentials. newLISP is LISP reborn as a scripting language: pragmatic and casual, simple to learn without requiring you to know advanced computer science concepts. Like any good scripting language, newLISP is quick to get into and gets the job done without fuss. newLISP has a very fast startup time, is small on resources like disk space and memory and has a deep, practical API with functions for networking, statistics, machine learning, regular expressions, multiprocessing and distributed computing built right into it, not added as a second thought in external modules.
- **ScriptX** [📁](./ScriptX) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/ScriptX) -- Tencent's [ScriptX](https://github.com/Tencent/ScriptX) is a script engine abstraction layer. A variety of script engines are encapsulated on the bottom and a unified API is exposed on the top, so that the upper-layer caller can completely isolate the underlying engine implementation (back-end).
  
  ScriptX not only isolates several JavaScript engines (e.g. V8 and QuickJS), but can even isolate different scripting languages, so that the upper layer can seamlessly switch between scripting engine and scripting language without changing the code.

- **tcl** [📁](./tcl) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/tcl) -- the latest **Tcl** source distribution. Tcl provides a powerful platform for creating integration applications that tie together diverse applications, protocols, devices, and frameworks.
- **tclclockmod** [📁](./tclclockmod) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/tclclockmod) -- TclClockMod is the fastest, most powerful Tcl clock engine written in C. This Tcl clock extension is the faster Tcl-module for the replacement of the standard "clock" ensemble of tcl.
- [Facebook's Hermes](https://github.com/facebook/hermes), [Samsung's Escargot](https://github.com/Samsung/escargot) and [XS/moddable](https://www.moddable.com/)<sup>[also](https://github.com/Moddable-OpenSource/moddable) [here](https://github.com/Moddable-OpenSource/moddable-xst)</sup>, which led me to [a webpage where various embeddable JS engines are compared size- and *performance*-wise](https://bellard.org/quickjs/bench.html).
- [Google's V8](https://v8.dev/)<sup>[here](https://github.com/v8/v8) [too](https://chromium.googlesource.com/v8/v8/+/84450a2239672109bcf537d6740b8babda521567)</sup>, as available in NodeJS, is deemed too complex for integration: when we go there, we could spend the same amount of effort on CPython integration -- though there again is the ever-present "how to debug this visually?!" question...)
- [JerryScript](https://github.com/jerryscript-project/jerryscript/): ES2017/2020 (good!), there's noises about Chrome Developer Tools on the Net for this one. Small, designed for embedded devices. I like that.
- mujs: ES5, no visual debugger. **Out.**
- [QuickJS](https://github.com/bellard/quickjs): ES2020, DevTools or [VS Code debugging](https://github.com/koush/vscode-quickjs-debug) seems to be available. Also comes with an interesting runtime: [txiki](https://github.com/saghul/txiki.js), which we still need to take a good look at.

**UPDATE 2021/June**: [JerryScript](https://github.com/jerryscript-project/jerryscript/), duktape, XS/moddable, escargot: these have been dropped as we picked QuickJS. After some initial hassle with that codebase, we picked a different branch to test, which was cleaner and compiled out of the box (CMake > MSVC), which is always a good omen for a codebase when you have cross-platform portability in mind.

## IPC: flatbuffer et al for protocol design

- **arrow** [📁](./arrow) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/arrow) -- Apache Arrow is a development platform for in-memory analytics. It contains a set of technologies that enable big data systems to process and move data fast. The reference Arrow libraries contain many distinct software components:
  
  - Columnar vector and table-like containers (similar to data frames) supporting
    flat or nested types
  
  - Conversions to and from other in-memory data structures
  - Integration tests for verifying binary compatibility between the
    implementations (e.g. sending data from Java to C++)
  
  - IO interfaces to local and remote filesystems
  - Readers and writers for various widely-used file formats (such as Parquet, CSV)
  - Reference-counted off-heap buffer memory management, for zero-copy memory
    sharing and handling memory-mapped files
  
  - Self-describing binary wire formats (streaming and batch/file-like) for
    remote procedure calls (RPC) and interprocess communication (IPC)

- **avro** [📁](./avro) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/avro) -- Apache Avro™ is a data serialization system.
- **bebop** [📁](./bebop) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/bebop) -- an extremely simple, fast, efficient, cross-platform serialization format. Bebop is a schema-based binary serialization technology, similar to Protocol Buffers or MessagePack. In particular, Bebop tries to be a good fit for client–server or distributed web apps that need something faster, more concise, and more type-safe than JSON or MessagePack, while also avoiding some of the complexity of Protocol Buffers, FlatBuffers and the like.
- **bitsery** [📁](./bitsery) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/bitsery) -- header only C++ binary serialization library, designed around the networking requirements for real-time data delivery, especially for games. All cross-platform requirements are enforced at compile time, so serialized data do not store any meta-data information and is as small as possible.
- **capnproto** [📁](./capnproto) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/capnproto) -- Cap'n Proto is an insanely fast data interchange format and capability-based RPC system. Think JSON, except binary. Or think [Protocol Buffers](https://github.com/google/protobuf), except faster.

- **GoldFish-CBOR** [📁](./GoldFish-CBOR) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/GoldFish) -- a fast JSON and CBOR streaming library, without using memory. GoldFish can parse and generate very large [JSON](http://json.org) or [CBOR](http://cbor.io) documents. It has some similarities to a [SAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_API_for_XML) parser, but doesn't use an event driven API, instead the user of the GoldFish interface is in control. GoldFish intends to be the easiest and one of the fastest JSON and CBOR streaming parser and serializer to use.
- **ion-c** [📁](./ion-c) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/ion-c) -- a C implementation of the [Ion data notation](http://amzn.github.io/ion-docs). Amazon Ion is a richly-typed, self-describing, hierarchical data serialization format offering interchangeable binary and text representations. The text format (a superset of JSON) is easy to read and author, supporting rapid prototyping. The binary representation is efficient to store, transmit, and skip-scan parse. The rich type system provides unambiguous semantics for long-term preservation of data which can survive multiple generations of software evolution.
- **libnop** [📁](./libnop) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/libnop) -- libnop (C++ Native Object Protocols) is a header-only library for serializing and deserializing C++ data types without external code generators or runtime support libraries.

It is used for building scripting language interfaces to C and C++ programs. SWIG simplifies development by largely automating the task of scripting language integration, allowing developers and users to focus on more important problems.
  
  *[SWIG 🌐](https://swig.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Manual/SWIG.html) was not considered initially; more suitable for RPC than what we have in mind, which is purely data messages enchange. MAY be of use for transitional applications which are mixed-(programming-)language based, e.g. where we want to mix C/C++ and C# in a single Test Application.*

- **thrift** [📁](./thrift) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/thrift) -- Apache Thrift is a lightweight, language-independent software stack for point-to-point RPC implementation. Thrift provides clean abstractions and implementations for data transport, data serialization, and application level processing.

- **velocypack** [📁](./velocypack) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/velocypack) -- a fast and compact format for serialization and storage.  These days, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation, see ECMA-404) is used in many cases where data has to be exchanged. Lots of protocols between different services use it, databases store JSON (document stores naturally, but others increasingly as well). It is popular, because it is simple, human-readable, and yet surprisingly versatile, despite its limitations. At the same time there is a plethora of alternatives ranging from XML over Universal Binary JSON, MongoDB's BSON, MessagePack, BJSON (binary JSON), Apache Thrift till Google's protocol buffers and ArangoDB's shaped JSON. When looking into this, we were surprised to find that none of these formats manages to combine compactness, platform independence, fast access to sub-objects and rapid conversion from and to JSON.

- ~~**flatbuffers** [🌐](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: see `protobuf`: same smell rising. Faster at run time, but still a bit hairy to my tastes while `bebop` et al are on to something *potentially nice*.

- ~~**flatcc** [🌐](https://github.com/dvidelabs/flatcc)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: see `flatbuffers`. When we don't dig `flatbuffers`, then `flatcc` is automatically pretty useless to us. Let's rephrase that professionally: "`flatcc` has moved out of scope for our project."

- ~~**libsmile** [🌐](https://github.com/pierre/libsmile) -- ["Smile" format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smile_%28data_interchange_format%29), i.e. a compact binary JSON format~~

At its core, BlazingMQ provides durable, fault-tolerant, highly performant, and highly available queues, along with features like various message routing strategies (e.g., work queues, priority, fan-out, broadcast, etc.), compression, strong consistency, poison pill detection, etc.  Message queues generally provide a loosely-coupled, asynchronous communication channel ("queue") between application services (producers and consumers) that send messages to one another. You can think about it like a mailbox for communication between application programs, where 'producer' drops a message in a mailbox and 'consumer' picks it up at its own leisure. Messages placed into the queue are stored until the recipient retrieves and processes them. In other words, producer and consumer applications can temporally and spatially isolate themselves from each other by using a message queue to facilitate communication.

The framework solves the problem of efficient I/O interactions transparently for the developers. Operations that would typically suspend the thread of execution do not suspend it. Instead of that, the thread processes other requests and tasks and returns to the handling of the operation only when it is guaranteed to execute immediately. As a result you get straightforward source code and avoid CPU-consuming context switches from OS, efficiently utilizing the CPU with a small amount of execution threads.
- **uvw** [📁](./uvw) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/uvw) -- `libuv` wrapper in modern C++. `uvw` started as a header-only, event based, tiny and easy to use wrapper for [`libuv`](https://github.com/libuv/libuv) written in modern C++.

- ~~**ice** [🌐](https://github.com/zeroc-ice/ice) -- Comprehensive RPC Framework: helps you network your software with minimal effort.~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: has a strong focus on the *remote*, i.e. `R` in `RPC` (thus a focus on things such as encryption, authentication, firewalling, etc.), which we don't want or need: all services are supposed to run on a single machine and comms go through `localhost` *only*. When folks find they need to distribute the workload across multiple machines, then we'll be entering a new era in Qiqqa usage and then will be soon enough to (re-)investigate the usefulness of this package.


Also, we are currently more interested in *fast data serialization* then RPC *per se* as we aim for a solution that's more akin to a REST API interface style.

- ~~**oatpp** [🌐](https://github.com/oatpp/oatpp) -- IPC / server framework~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: see `crow`. We have picked `crow` as the preferred way forward, so any similar/competing product is out of scope unless `crow` throws a tantrum on our test bench after all, the chances of that being *very slim*.

## IPC: YAML, TOML, etc. for protocol design

**Not considered**: reason: when we want the IPC protocol to be "human readable" in any form/approximation, we've decided to stick with JSON or XML (if we cannot help it -- I particularly dislike the verbosity and tag redundancy (open+close) in XML and consider it a lousy design choice for *any* purpose).

The more human readable formats (YAML, TOML, ...) are intended for human to machine communications, e.g. for feeding configurations into applications, and **SHOULD NOT** be used for IPC anywhere. (Though I must say I'm on the fence where it comes using YAML as an alternative IPC format where it replaces JSON; another contender there are the JSON5/JSON6 formats.)











## Content Hashing (cryptographic strength i.e. *"guaranteed"* collision-free)

The bit about **_"guaranteed"_ collision-free** is to be read as: hash algorithms in this section must come with *strong statistical guarantees* that any chance at a **hash collision** is negligible, even for *extremely large* collections. In practice this means: use *cryptographic* hash algorithms with a *strength* of 128 bits or more. (Qiqqa used a b0rked version SHA1 thus far, which is considered too weak as we already sample PDFs which cause a hash collision for the *official* SHA1 algo (and thus also collide in our b0rked SHA1 variant): while those can still be argued to be fringe case, I don't want to be bothered with this at all and thus choose to err on the side of 'better than SHA1B' here. Meanwhile, any library in here *may* contain weaker cryptographic hashes alongside: we won't be using those for **content hashing**.

PRVHASH is conceptually similar (in the sense of using a pseudo-random number sequence as a hash) to [`keccak`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3) and [`RadioGatun`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RadioGat%C3%BAn) schemes, but is a completely different implementation of such concept. PRVHASH is both a ["randomness extractor"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness_extractor) and an "extendable-output function" (XOF).
- **SipHash** [📁](./SipHash) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/SipHash) -- SipHash is a family of pseudorandom functions (PRFs) optimized for speed on short messages. This is the reference C code of SipHash: portable, simple, optimized for clarity and debugging. SipHash was designed in 2012 by [Jean-Philippe Aumasson](https://aumasson.jp) and [Daniel J. Bernstein](https://cr.yp.to) as a defense against [hash-flooding DoS attacks](https://aumasson.jp/siphash/siphashdos_29c3_slides.pdf).
  
  It is *simpler and faster* on short messages than previous cryptographic algorithms, such as MACs based on universal hashing, *competitive in performance* with insecure non-cryptographic algorithms, such as [fhhash](https://github.com/cbreeden/fxhash), *cryptographically secure*, with no sign of weakness despite multiple [cryptanalysis](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/865) [projects](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/865) by leading cryptographers, *battle-tested*, with successful integration in OSs (Linux kernel, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, FreeRTOS), languages (Perl, Python, Ruby, etc.), libraries (OpenSSL libcrypto, Sodium, etc.) and applications (Wireguard, Redis, etc.).
  
  As a secure pseudorandom function (a.k.a. keyed hash function), SipHash can also be used as a secure message authentication code (MAC). But SipHash is *not a hash* in the sense of general-purpose key-less hash function such as BLAKE3 or SHA-3. SipHash should therefore always be used with a secret key in order to be secure.

## Hash-like Filters & Fast Hashing for Hash Tables et al (64 bits and less, mostly)

These hashes are for other purposes, e.g. fast lookup in dictionaries, fast approximate hit testing and set reduction through fast filtering (think *bloom filter*). These *may* be **machine specific** (and some of them *are*): these are **never supposed to be used for encoding in storage or other means which crosses machine boundaries**: if you want to use them for a database index, that is fine *as long as* you don't expect that database index to be readable by any other machine than the one which produced and uses these hash numbers.

> As you can see from the list below, I went on a shopping spree, having fun with all the latest, including some *possibly insane* stuff that's only really useful for particular edge cases -- which we *hope to avoid ourselves, for a while at least*. Anyway, I'ld say we've got the motherlode here. Simple fun for those days when your brain-flag is at half-mast. Enjoy.

- **adaptiveqf** [📁](./adaptiveqf) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/adaptiveqf) -- [Adaptive Quotient Filter (AQF)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02866) supports approximate membership testing and counting the occurrences of items in a data set. Like other AMQs, the AQF has a chance for false positives during queries. However, the AQF has the ability to adapt to false positives after they have occurred so they are not repeated. At the same time, the AQF maintains the benefits of a quotient filter, as it is small and fast, has good locality of reference, scales out of RAM to SSD, and supports deletions, counting, resizing, merging, and highly concurrent access.

BCF reduces the average number of relocations of the state-of-the-art CF by 35%.
  
  - **left-for-dead**; reason: has some GCC + Linux specific coding constructs: intrinsics + Linux-only API calls, which increase the cost of porting.

- **CRoaring** [📁](./CRoaring) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/CRoaring) -- portable Roaring bitmaps in C (and C++). Bitsets, also called bitmaps, are commonly used as fast data structures. Unfortunately, they can use too much memory. To compensate, we often use compressed bitmaps. Roaring bitmaps are compressed bitmaps which tend to outperform conventional compressed bitmaps such as WAH, EWAH or Concise. They are used by several major systems such as Apache Lucene and derivative systems such as Solr and Elasticsearch, etc.. The CRoaring library is used in several systems such as Apache Doris.
- **cuckoofilter** [📁](./cuckoofilter) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/cuckoofilter) -- Cuckoo Filter is a Bloom filter replacement for approximated set-membership queries. While Bloom filters are well-known space-efficient data structures to serve queries like "if item x is in a set?", they do not support deletion. Their variances to enable deletion (like counting Bloom filters) usually require much more space. Cuckoo ﬁlters provide the ﬂexibility to add and remove items dynamically. A cuckoo filter is based on cuckoo hashing (and therefore named as cuckoo filter).  It is essentially a cuckoo hash table storing each key's fingerprint. Cuckoo hash tables can be highly compact, thus a cuckoo filter could use less space than conventional Bloom ﬁlters, for applications that require low false positive rates (< 3%).
- **cuckoo-index** [📁](./cuckoo-index) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/cuckoo-index) -- Cuckoo Index (CI) is a lightweight secondary index structure that represents the many-to-many relationship between keys and partitions of columns in a highly space-efficient way. CI associates variable-sized fingerprints in a Cuckoo filter with compressed bitmaps indicating qualifying partitions. The problem of finding all partitions that possibly contain a given lookup key is traditionally solved by maintaining one filter (e.g., a Bloom filter) per partition that indexes all unique key values contained in this partition. To identify all partitions containing a key, we would need to probe all per-partition filters (which could be many). Depending on the storage medium, a false positive there can be very expensive. Furthermore, secondary columns typically contain many duplicates (also across partitions). Cuckoo Index (CI) addresses these drawbacks of per-partition filters. (It must know all keys at build time, though.)
- **DCF-cuckoo-index** [📁](./DCF-cuckoo-index) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/DCF) -- the Dynamic Cuckoo Filter (DCF) is an efficient approximate membership test data structure. Different from the classic Bloom filter and its variants, DCF is especially designed for highly dynamic datasets and supports extending and reducing its capacity. The DCF design is the first to achieve both reliable item deletion and flexibly extending/reducing for approximate set representation and membership testing. DCF outperforms the state-of-the-art DBF designs in both speed and memory consumption.
- **emphf-hash** [📁](./emphf-hash) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/emphf) -- an efficient external-memory algorithm for the construction of minimal perfect hash functions for large-scale key sets, focusing on speed and low memory usage (2.61 N bits plus a small constant factor).
- **EWAHBoolArray** [📁](./EWAHBoolArray) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/EWAHBoolArray) -- a C++ compressed bitset data structure (also called bitset or bit vector). It supports several word sizes by a template parameter (16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit). You should expect the 64-bit word-size to provide better performance, but higher memory usage, while a 32-bit word-size might compress a bit better, at the expense of some performance.
- **eytzinger** [📁](./eytzinger) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/eytzinger) -- `fixed_eytzinger_map` is a free implementation of Eytzinger’s layout, in a form of an STL-like generic associative container, broadly compatible with a well-established access patterns. An Eytzinger map, or BFS(breadth-first search) map, places elements in a lookup order, which leads to a better memory locality. In practice, such container can outperform searching in sorted arrays, like `boost::flat_map`, due to less cache misses made in a lookup process. In comparison with RB-based trees, like `std::map`, lookup in Eytzinger map can be multiple times faster. Some comparison graphs are [given here](https://kazakov.life/2017/03/06/cache-friendly-associative-container/).

We provide four container classes `fph::DynamicFphSet`,`fph::DynamicFphMap`,`fph::MetaFphSet` and `fph::MetaFphMap`. The APIs of these four classes are almost the same as those of `std::unordered_set` and `std::unordered_map`.
- **fsst** [📁](./fsst) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/fsst) -- Fast Static Symbol Table (FSST): fast text compression that allows random access. See also the PVLDB paper https://github.com/cwida/fsst/raw/master/fsstcompression.pdf. FSST is a compression scheme focused on string/text data: it can compress strings from distributions with many different values (i.e. where dictionary compression will not work well). It allows *random-access* to compressed data: it is not block-based, so individual strings can be decompressed without touching the surrounding data in a compressed block. When compared to e.g. LZ4 (which is block-based), FSST further achieves similar decompression speed and compression speed, and better compression ratio. FSST encodes strings using a symbol table -- but it works on pieces of the string, as it maps "symbols" (1-8 byte sequences) onto "codes" (single-bytes). FSST can also represent a byte as an exception (255 followed by the original byte). Hence, compression transforms a sequence of bytes into a (supposedly shorter) sequence of codes or escaped bytes. These shorter byte-sequences could be seen as strings again and fit in whatever your program is that manipulates strings. An optional 0-terminated mode (like, C-strings) is also supported.

- **HashMap** [📁](./HashMap) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/HashMap) -- a hash table mostly compatible with the C++11 *std::unordered_map* interface, but with much higher performance for many workloads. This hash table uses open addressing with linear probing and backshift deletion. Open addressing and linear probing minimizes memory allocations and achieves high cache efficiency. Backshift deletion keeps performance high for delete heavy workloads by not clobbering the hash table with tombestones.

- **morton_filter** [📁](./morton_filter) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/morton_filter) -- a [Morton filter](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol11/p1041-breslow.pdf) -- a new approximate set membership data structure. A Morton filter is a modified cuckoo filter that is optimized for bandwidth-constrained systems. Morton filters use additional computation in order to reduce their off-chip memory traffic. Like a cuckoo filter, a Morton filter supports insertions, deletions, and lookup operations. It additionally adds high-throughput self-resizing, a feature of quotient filters, which allows a Morton filter to increase its capacity solely by leveraging its internal representation. This capability is in contrast to existing vanilla cuckoo filter implementations, which are static and thus require using a backing data structure that contains the full set of items to resize the filter. Morton filters can also be configured to use less memory than a cuckoo filter for the same error rate while simultaneously delivering insertion, deletion, and lookup throughputs that are, respectively, up to 15.5x, 1.3x, and 2.5x higher than a cuckoo filter. Morton filters in contrast to vanilla cuckoo filters do not require a power of two number of buckets but rather only a number that is a multiple of two. They also use fewer bits per item than a Bloom filter when the target false positive rate is less than around 1% to 3%.
- **mutable_rank_select** [📁](./mutable_rank_select) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/mutable_rank_select) -- Rank/Select Queries over Mutable Bitmaps. Given a *mutable* bitmap `B[0..u)` where `n` bits are set, the *rank/select problem* asks for a data structure built from `B` that supports `rank(i)` (the number of bits set in `B[0..i]`, for 0 ≤ i < u), `select(i)` (the position of the i-th bit set, for 0 ≤ i < n), `flip(i)` (toggles `B[i]`, for 0 ≤ i < u) and `access(i)` (return `B[i]`, for 0 ≤ i < u). The input bitmap is partitioned into blocks and a tree index is built over them. The tree index implemented in the library is an optimized b-ary Segment-Tree with SIMD AVX2/AVX-512 instructions. You can test a block size of 256 or 512 bits, and various rank/select algorithms for the blocks such as broadword techniques, CPU intrinsics, and SIMD instructions.
- **nedtries** [📁](./nedtries) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/nedtries) -- an in-place bitwise binary Fredkin trie algorithm which allows for near constant time insertions, deletions, finds, closest fit finds and iteration. On modern hardware it is approximately 50-100% faster than red-black binary trees, it handily beats even the venerable O(1) hash table for less than 3000 objects and it is barely slower than the hash table for 10000 objects. Past 10000 objects you probably ought to use a hash table though, and if you need nearest fit rather than close fit then red-black trees are still optimal.
- **OZBCBitmap** [📁](./OZBCBitmap) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/OZBCBitmap) -- OZBC provides an efficent compressed bitmap to create bitmap indexes on high-cardinality columns. Bitmap indexes have traditionally been considered to work well for low-cardinality columns, which have a modest number of distinct values. The simplest and most common method of bitmap indexing on attribute A with K cardinality associates a bitmap with every attribute value V then the Vth bitmap rapresent the predicate A=V. This approach ensures an efficient solution for performing search but on high-cardinality attributes the size of the bitmap index increase dramatically. OZBC is a run-length-encoded hybrid compressed bitmap designed exclusively to create a bitmap indexes on L cardinality attributes where L>=16 and provide bitwise logical operations in running time complexity proportianl to the compressed bitmap size.

- **rollinghashcpp** [📁](./rollinghashcpp) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/rollinghashcpp) -- randomized rolling hash functions in C++. This is a set of C++ classes implementing various recursive n-gram hashing techniques, also called rolling hashing (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_hash), including Randomized Karp-Rabin (sometimes called Rabin-Karp), Hashing by Cyclic Polynomials (also known as Buzhash) and Hashing by Irreducible Polynomials.
- **semimap** [📁](./semimap) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/semimap) -- semi::static_map and semi::map: associative map containers with compile-time lookup! Normally, associative containers require some runtime overhead when looking up their values from a key. However, when the key is known at compile-time (for example, when the key is a literal) then this run-time lookup could technically be avoided. This is exactly what the goal of `semi::static_map` and `semi::map` is.
- **SipHash** [📁](./SipHash) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/SipHash) -- SipHash is a family of pseudorandom functions (PRFs) optimized for speed on short messages. This is the reference C code of SipHash: portable, simple, optimized for clarity and debugging. SipHash was designed in 2012 by [Jean-Philippe Aumasson](https://aumasson.jp) and [Daniel J. Bernstein](https://cr.yp.to) as a defense against [hash-flooding DoS attacks](https://aumasson.jp/siphash/siphashdos_29c3_slides.pdf).
  
  It is *simpler and faster* on short messages than previous cryptographic algorithms, such as MACs based on universal hashing, *competitive in performance* with insecure non-cryptographic algorithms, such as [fhhash](https://github.com/cbreeden/fxhash), *cryptographically secure*, with no sign of weakness despite multiple [cryptanalysis](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/865) [projects](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/865) by leading cryptographers, *battle-tested*, with successful integration in OSs (Linux kernel, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, FreeRTOS), languages (Perl, Python, Ruby, etc.), libraries (OpenSSL libcrypto, Sodium, etc.) and applications (Wireguard, Redis, etc.).
  
  As a secure pseudorandom function (a.k.a. keyed hash function), SipHash can also be used as a secure message authentication code (MAC). But SipHash is *not a hash* in the sense of general-purpose key-less hash function such as BLAKE3 or SHA-3. SipHash should therefore always be used with a secret key in order to be secure.

- **slot_map** [📁](./slot_map) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/slot_map) -- a Slot Map is a high-performance associative container with persistent unique keys to access stored values. Upon insertion, a key is returned that can be used to later access or remove the values. Insertion, removal, and access are all guaranteed to take `O(1)` time (best, worst, and average case). Great for storing collections of objects that need stable, safe references but have no clear ownership. The difference between a `std::unordered_map` and a `dod::slot_map` is that the slot map generates and returns the key when inserting a value. A key is always unique and will only refer to the value that was inserted.

- **wyhash** [📁](./wyhash) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/wyhash) -- No hash function is perfect, but some are useful. `wyhash` and `wyrand` are the ideal 64-bit hash function and PRNG respectively: solid, portable, fastest (especially for short keys), salted (using a dynamic secret to avoid intended attack).
- **xor-and-binary-fuse-filter** [📁](./xor-and-binary-fuse-filter) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/xor_singleheader) -- XOR and Binary Fuse Filter library: Bloom filters are used to quickly check whether an element is part of a set. Xor filters and binary fuse filters are faster and more concise alternative to Bloom filters. They are also smaller than cuckoo filters. They are used in [production systems](https://github.com/datafuselabs/databend).
- **xsg** [📁](./xsg) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/xsg) -- XOR [BST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree) implementations are related to the [XOR linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_linked_list), a [doubly linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list) variant, from where we borrow the idea about how links between nodes are to be implemented. Modest resource requirements and simplicity make XOR [scapegoat trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapegoat_tree) stand out of the [BST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree) crowd. All iterators (except `end()` iterators), but not references and pointers, are invalidated, after inserting or erasing from this XOR [scapegoat tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapegoat_tree) implementation. You can dereference invalidated iterators, if they were not erased, but you cannot iterate with them. `end()` iterators are constant and always valid, but dereferencing them results in undefined behavior.
- **xxHash** [📁](./xxHash) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/xxHash) -- fast (non-cryptographic) hash algorithm
- ~~**circlehash** [📁](./circlehash) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/circlehash) -- a family of non-cryptographic hash functions that pass every test in SMHasher.~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: written in Go; port to C/C++ is easy but just too much effort for too little gain; when we're looking for *fast* non-cryptographic hashes like this, we don't it to include 128-bit / 64-bit multiplications as those are generally slower than shift, add, xor. While this will surely be a nice hash, it doesn't fit our purposes.

- **stlcache** [📁](./stlcache) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/stlcache) -- STL::Cache is an in-memory cache for C++ applications. STL::Cache is just a simple wrapper over standard map, that implements some cache algorithms, thus allowing you to limit the storage size and automatically remove unused items from it. It is intended to be used for keeping any key/value data, especially when data's size are too big, to just put it into the map and keep the whole thing. With STL::Cache you could put enormous (really unlimited) amount of data into it, but it will store only some small part of your data. So re-usable data will be kept near your code and not so popular data will not spend expensive memory. STL::Cache uses configurable policies, for decisions, whether data are good, to be kept in cache or they should be thrown away. It is shipped with 8 policies and you are free to implement your own.

- **lmdb-safe** [📁](./lmdb-safe) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/lmdb-safe) -- A safe modern & performant C++ wrapper of LMDB. LMDB is an outrageously fast key/value store with semantics that make it highly interesting for many applications. Of specific note, besides speed, is the full support for transactions and good read/write concurrency. LMDB is also famed for its robustness.. **when used correctly**. The design of LMDB is elegant and simple, which aids both the performance and stability. The downside of this elegant design is a nontrivial set of rules that need to be followed to not break things. In other words, LMDB delivers great things but only if you use it exactly right. This is by conscious design. The `lmdb-safe` library aims to deliver the full LMDB performance while programmatically making sure the LMDB semantics are adhered to, with very limited overhead.

H5CPP simplifies interactions with popular linear algebra libraries, provides compiler assisted seamless object persistence, Standard Template Library support and comes equipped with a novel error handling architecture.
  
  - **in-purgatory**; reason: see the `HDF5` entry below. But advertises to be an interface between OpenCV, Eigen, etc. at the same time...

- ~~**HDF5** [🌐](https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf5)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: HDF5 is a nice concept but considered *overkill* right now; where we need disk stores, we'll be using SQLite or LMDB-like key-value stores instead. Such stores are not meant to be interchangeable with other software in their raw shape and we'll provide public access APIs instead, where applicable.

- **fast-lzma2** [📁](./fast-lzma2) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/fast-lzma2) -- the __Fast LZMA2 Library__ is a lossless high-ratio data compression library based on Igor Pavlov's LZMA2 codec from 7-zip. Binaries of 7-Zip forks which use the algorithm are available in the [7-Zip-FL2 project](https://github.com/conor42/7-Zip-FL2/releases/), the [7-Zip-zstd project](https://github.com/mcmilk/7-Zip-zstd/releases/), and the active fork of [p7zip](https://github.com/szcnick/p7zip/releases/).

See also the PVLDB paper https://github.com/cwida/fsst/raw/master/fsstcompression.pdf. FSST is a compression scheme focused on string/text data: it can compress strings from distributions with many different values (i.e. where dictionary compression will not work well). It allows *random-access* to compressed data: it is not block-based, so individual strings can be decompressed without touching the surrounding data in a compressed block. When compared to e.g. LZ4 (which is block-based), FSST further achieves similar decompression speed and compression speed, and better compression ratio. FSST encodes strings using a symbol table -- but it works on pieces of the string, as it maps "symbols" (1-8 byte sequences) onto "codes" (single-bytes). FSST can also represent a byte as an exception (255 followed by the original byte). Hence, compression transforms a sequence of bytes into a (supposedly shorter) sequence of codes or escaped bytes. These shorter byte-sequences could be seen as strings again and fit in whatever your program is that manipulates strings. An optional 0-terminated mode (like, C-strings) is also supported.
- **libCSD** [📁](./libCSD) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/libCSD) -- a C++ library providing some different techniques for managing string dictionaries in compressed space. These approaches are inspired on the paper: "Compressed String Dictionaries", Nieves R. Brisaboa, Rodrigo Cánovas, Francisco Claude, Miguel A. Martínez-Prieto, and Gonzalo Navarro, 10th Symposium on Experimental Algorithms (SEA'2011), p.136-147, 2011.

  - fastLZ4 + Huffman : compression levels -30...-39 add Huffman coding to fastLZ4
  - LIZv1 : compression levels -20...-29 are designed to give better ratio than [LZ4] keeping 75% decompression speed

  - **second-choice**; reason: see `lzo2` above. LZ4 either overtakes this one or is on par (anno 2022 AD) and I don't see a lot happening here, so the coolness factor is slowly fading.

The rsync algorithm is different from most differencing algorithms because it does not require the presence of the two files to calculate the delta.  Instead, it requires a set of checksums of each block of one file, which together form a signature for that file.  Blocks at any position in the other file which have the same checksum are likely to be identical, and whatever remains is the difference. This algorithm transfers the differences between two files without needing both files on the same system.

- **zsync2** [📁](./zsync2) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/zsync2) -- the advanced file download/sync tool zsync. zsync is a well known tool for downloading and updating local files from HTTP servers using the well known algorithms rsync used for diffing binary files. Therefore, it becomes possible to synchronize modifications by exchanging the changed blocks locally using `Range:` requests. The system is based on meta files called `.zsync` files. They contain hash sums for every block of data. The file is generated from and stored along with the actual file it refers to. Due to how system works, nothing but a "dumb" HTTP server is required to make use of zsync2. This makes it easy to integrate zsync2 into existing systems.

- **CurvatureFilter** [📁](./CurvatureFilter) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/CurvatureFilter) -- Curvature filters are efficient solvers for variational models. Traditional solvers, such as gradient descent or Euler Lagrange Equation, start at the total energy and use diffusion scheme to carry out the minimization. When the initial condition is the original image, the data fitting energy always increases while the regularization energy always reduces during the optimization, as illustrated in the below figure. Thus, regularization energy must be the dominant part since the total energy has to decrease. Therefore, **Curvature filters focus on minimizing the regularization term,** whose minimizers are already known. For example, if the regularization is Gaussian curvature, the developable surfaces minimize this energy. Therefore, in curvature filter, developable surfaces are used to approximate the data. **As long as the decreased amount in the regularization part is larger than the increased amount in the data fitting energy, the total energy is reduced.**

The weights can be used to represent the cost of taking a particular transition. FSTs have key applications in speech recognition and synthesis, machine translation, optical character recognition, pattern matching, string processing, machine learning, information extraction and retrieval among others. Often a weighted transducer is used to represent a probabilistic model (e.g., an n-gram model, pronunciation model). FSTs can be optimized by determinization and minimization, models can be applied to hypothesis sets (also represented as automata) or cascaded by finite-state composition, and the best results can be selected by shortest-path algorithms.

- **annoy** [📁](./annoy) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/annoy) -- ANNOY (<b>A</b>pproximate <b>N</b>earest <b>N</b>eighbors <b>O</b>h <b>Y</b>eah) is a C++ library to search for points in space that are close to a given query point. It also creates large read-only file-based data structures that are `mmap`-ped into memory so that many processes may share the same data. ANNOY is almost as fast as the fastest libraries, but what really sets Annoy apart is: it has the ability to use static files as indexes, enabling you to share an index across processes. ANNOY also decouples creating indexes from loading them, so you can pass around indexes as files and map them into memory quickly. ANNOY tries to minimize its memory footprint: the indexes are quite small. This is useful when you want to find nearest neighbors using multiple CPU's. Spotify uses ANNOY for music recommendations.

Testing if two stings differs by a small amount is a prevalent function that is used in many applications. One of its biggest usage, perhaps, is in DNA or protein mapping, where a short DNA or protein string is compared against an enormous database, in order to find similar matches. In such applications, a query string is usually compared against multiple candidate strings in the database. Only candidates that are similar to the query are considered **matches** and recorded.  SHD expands the basic Hamming distance computation, which only detects substitutions, into a full-fledged edit-distance filter, which counts not only substitutions but **insertions and deletions** as well.

  Although continuous bag of word (CBOW) embeddings can be trained more quickly than skipgram (SG) embeddings, it is a common belief that SG embeddings tend to perform better in practice. This was observed by the original authors of Word2Vec [1] and also in subsequent work [2].  However, we found that popular implementations of word2vec with negative sampling such as [word2vec](https://github.com/tmikolov/word2vec/) and [gensim](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim/) do not implement the CBOW update correctly, thus potentially leading to misconceptions about the performance of CBOW embeddings when trained correctly.

- **scws-chinese-word-segmentation** [📁](./scws-chinese-word-segmentation) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/scws) -- SCWS (Simple Chinese Word Segmentation) (i.e.: Simple Chinese Word Segmentation System). This is a mechanical Chinese word segmentation engine based on word frequency dictionary, which can basically correctly segment a whole paragraph of Chinese text into words. A word is the smallest morpheme unit in Chinese, but when writing, it does not separate words with spaces like English, so how to segment words accurately and quickly has always been a difficult problem in Chinese word segmentation. SCWS supports Chinese encoding includes `GBK`, `UTF-8`, etc.
  
  There are not many innovative elements in the word segmentation algorithm.

- **libwildmatch** [📁](./libwildmatch) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/wildmatch) -- wildmatch is a BSD-licensed C/C++ library for git/rsync-style pattern matching.
- **pcre** [📁](./pcre) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/pcre) -- PCRE2 : Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions.

PCRE2 has its own native API, as well as a set of wrapper functions that correspond to the POSIX regular expression API. It comes in three forms, for processing 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit code units, in either literal or UTF encoding.
- **pdfgrep** [📁](./pdfgrep) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/pdfgrep) -- a tool to search text in PDF files. It works similarly to *grep*.

- **re2c** [📁](./re2c) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/re2c) -- a lexer generator for C/C++, Go and Rust. Its main goal is generating fast lexers: at least as fast as their reasonably optimized hand-coded counterparts. Instead of using traditional table-driven approach, re2c encodes the generated finite state automata directly in the form of conditional jumps and comparisons. The resulting programs are faster and often smaller than their table-driven analogues, and they are much easier to debug and understand. re2c applies quite a few optimizations in order to speed up and compress the generated code.  Another distinctive feature is its flexible interface: instead of assuming a fixed program template, re2c lets the programmer write most of the interface code and adapt the generated lexer to any particular environment.
- **RE-flex** [📁](./RE-flex) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/RE-flex) -- the regex-centric, fast lexical analyzer generator for C++ with full Unicode support. Faster than Flex.

Seamlessly integrates with Bison and other parsers.
  
  The RE/flex matcher tracks line numbers, column numbers, and indentations, whereas Flex does not (option `noyylineno`) and neither do the other regex matchers (except PCRE2 and Boost.Regex when used with RE/flex).
  Tracking this information incurs some overhead. RE/flex also automatically decodes UTF-8/16/32 input and accepts `std::istream`, strings, and wide strings as input.
  
  RE/flex runs equally fast or slightly faster than the best times of Flex.

- **tre** [📁](./tre) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/tre) -- TRE is a lightweight, robust, and efficient POSIX compliant regexp matching library with some exciting features such as approximate (fuzzy) matching.

- **giflib-turbo** [📁](./giflib-turbo) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/giflib-turbo) -- GIFLIB-Turbo is a faster drop-in replacement for GIFLIB. The original GIF codecs were written for a much different world and took great pains to use as little memory as possible and to accommodate a slow and unreliable input stream of data. Those constraints are no longer a problem for the vast majority of users and they were hurting the performance. Another feature holding back the performance of the original GIFLIB was that the original codec was designed to work with image data a line at a time and used a separate LZW dictionary to manage the strings of repeating symbols. My codec uses the output image as the dictionary; this allows much faster 'unwinding' of the codes since they are all stored in the right direction to just be copied to the new location.

### Random generators & all things random

- **EigenRand** [📁](./EigenRand) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/EigenRand) -- EigenRand: The Fastest C++11-compatible random distribution generator for Eigen. EigenRand is a header-only library for [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page), providing vectorized random number engines and vectorized random distribution generators.  Since the classic Random functions of Eigen rely on an old C function `rand()`, there is no way to control random numbers and no guarantee for quality of generated numbers. In addition, Eigen's Random is slow because `rand()` is hard to vectorize. EigenRand provides a variety of random distribution functions similar to C++11 standard's random functions, which can be vectorized and easily integrated into Eigen's expressions of Matrix and Array. You can get 5~10 times speed by just replacing old Eigen's Random or unvectorizable c++11 random number generators with EigenRand.

### Regression, curve fitting, polynomials, splines, geometrics, interpolation, math

- **baobzi** [📁](./baobzi) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/baobzi) -- an adaptive fast function approximator based on tree search. Word salad aside, `baobzi` is a tool to convert very CPU intensive function calculations into relatively cheap ones (at the cost of memory). This is similar to functions like `chebeval` in `MATLAB`, but can be significantly faster since the order of the polynomial fit can be much much lower to meet similar tolerances. It also isn't constrained for use only in `MATLAB`. Internally, `baobzi` represents your function by a grid of binary/quad/oct/N trees, where the leaves represent the function in some small sub-box of the function's domain with chebyshev polynomials. When you evaluate your function at a point with baobzi, it searches the tree for the box containing your point and evaluates using this approximant.

Word salad aside, `baobzi` is a tool to convert very CPU intensive function calculations into relatively cheap ones (at the cost of memory). This is similar to functions like `chebeval` in `MATLAB`, but can be significantly faster since the order of the polynomial fit can be much much lower to meet similar tolerances. It also isn't constrained for use only in `MATLAB`. Internally, `baobzi` represents your function by a grid of binary/quad/oct/N trees, where the leaves represent the function in some small sub-box of the function's domain with chebyshev polynomials. When you evaluate your function at a point with baobzi, it searches the tree for the box containing your point and evaluates using this approximant.

In practice this means that HDBSCAN returns a good clustering straight away with little or no parameter tuning -- and the primary parameter, minimum cluster size, is intuitive and easy to select. HDBSCAN is ideal for exploratory data analysis; it's a fast and robust algorithm that you can trust to return meaningful clusters (if there are any).

So why use it then? What makes xmunch different from the other tools is the ability to extend incomplete word-lists. For hunspell's munch to identify a stem and add an affix mark, every word formed by the affix with the stem has to be in the original word-list. This makes sense for a compression tool. However if your word list is incomplete, you have to add all possible word-forms of a word first, before any compression is done. Using xmunch instead, you can define a subset of forms which are required to be in the word-list to allow the word to be used as stem. Like this, you can extend the word-list.

- **sac** [📁](./sac) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/sac) -- a state-of-the-art lossless audio compression model. Lossless audio compression is a complex problem, because PCM data is highly non-stationary and uses high sample resolution (typically >=16bit). That's why classic context modelling suffers from context dilution problems. Sac employs a simple OLS-NLMS predictor per frame including bias correction. Prediction residuals are encoded using a sophisticated bitplane coder including SSE and various forms of probability estimations. Meta-parameters of the predictor are optimized via binary search (or [DDS](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2005WR004723)) on by-frame basis. This results in a highly asymmetric codec design. We throw a lot of muscles at the problem and archive only little gains - by practically predicting noise.

  ICS stands for Image Cytometry Standard, and was first proposed in: P. Dean, L. Mascio, D. Ow, D. Sudar, J. Mullikin, "Propsed standard for image cytometry data files", Cytometry, n.11, pp.561-569, 1990. 
  
  It writes 2 files, one is the header, with an '.ics' extension, and the other is the actual image data (with an '.ids' extension.)
  
  ICS version 2.0 extends this standard to allow for a more versatile placement of the image data. It can now be placed either in the same '.ics' file or inbedded in any other file, by specifying the file name and the byte offset for the data.
  
  The advantage of ICS over other open standards such as TIFF is that it allows data of any type and dimensionality to be stored. A TIFF file can contain a collection of 2D images; it's up to the user to determine how these relate to each other. An ICS file can contain, for exmaple, a 5D image in which the 4th dimension is the light frequency and the 5th time. Also, all of the information regarding the microscope settings (or whatever instument was used to acquire the image) and the sample preparation can be included in the file.

So why use it then? What makes xmunch different from the other tools is the ability to extend incomplete word-lists. For hunspell's munch to identify a stem and add an affix mark, every word formed by the affix with the stem has to be in the original word-list. This makes sense for a compression tool. However if your word list is incomplete, you have to add all possible word-forms of a word first, before any compression is done. Using xmunch instead, you can define a subset of forms which are required to be in the word-list to allow the word to be used as stem. Like this, you can extend the word-list.

## FTS (*Full Text Search*) and related: SOLR/Lucene et al: document content search

We'll be using SOLR mostly, but here might be some interface libraries and an intersting alternative

- **Bi-Sent2Vec** [📁](./Bi-Sent2Vec) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/Bi-Sent2Vec) -- provides cross-lingual numerical representations (features) for words, short texts, or sentences, which can be used as input to any machine learning task with applications geared towards cross-lingual word translation, cross-lingual sentence retrieval as well as cross-lingual downstream NLP tasks. The library is a cross-lingual extension of [Sent2Vec](https://github.com/epfml/sent2vec). Bi-Sent2Vec vectors are also well suited to monolingual tasks as indicated by a marked improvement in the monolingual quality of the word embeddings. (For more details, see [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12481))
- **BitFunnel** [📁](./BitFunnel) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/BitFunnel) -- the BitFunnel search index is used by [Bing's](http://www.bing.com) super-fresh, news, and media indexes. The algorithm is described in [BitFunnel: Revisiting Signatures for
- **completesearch** [📁](./completesearch) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/completesearch) -- a fast and interactive search engine for *context-sensitive prefix search* on a given collection of documents. It does not only provide search results, like a regular search engine, but also completions for the last (maybe only partially typed) query word that lead to a hit.
- **edit-distance** [📁](./edit-distance) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/editdistance) -- a fast implementation of the edit distance (Levenshtein distance). The algorithm used in this library is proposed by _Heikki Hyyrö, "Explaining and extending the bit-parallel approximate string matching algorithm of Myers", (2001) <http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.19.7158&rep=rep1&type=pdf>_.

- **groonga** [📁](./groonga) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/groonga) -- an open-source fulltext search engine and column store.
- **iresearch** [📁](./iresearch) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/iresearch) -- the IResearch search engine is meant to be treated as a standalone index that is capable of both indexing and storing individual values verbatim. Indexed data is treated on a per-version/per-revision basis, i.e. existing data version/revision is never modified and updates/removals are treated as new versions/revisions of the said data. This allows for trivial multi-threaded read/write operations on the index. The index exposes its data processing functionality via a multi-threaded 'writer' interface that treats each document abstraction as a collection of fields to index and/or store. The index exposes its data retrieval functionality via 'reader' interface that returns records from an index matching a specified query. The queries themselves are constructed query trees built directly using the query building blocks available in the API. The querying infrastructure provides the capability of ordering the result set by one or more ranking/scoring implementations. The ranking/scoring implementation logic is plugin-based and lazy-initialized during runtime as needed, allowing for addition of custom ranking/scoring logic without the need to even recompile the IResearch library.
- **libchopshop** [📁](./libchopshop) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/libchopshop) -- NLP/text processing with automated stop word detection and stemmer-based filtering.

When used in combination with [Manticore Search](https://github.com/manticoresoftware/manticoresearch) it can be beneficial for those looking for:
    
    1. log analytics including rich free text search capabities (which is missing in e.g. [Clickhouse](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse) - great tool for metrics analytics)
    2. faster / low resource consumption log/metrics analytics. Since the library and Manticore Search are both written in C++ with low optimizations in mind, in many cases the performance / RAM consumption is better than in Lucene / SOLR / Elasticsearch
    3. running log / metric analytics in docker / kubernetes. Manticore Search + the library can work with as little as 30 megabytes of RAM which Elasticsearch / Clickhouse can't. It also starts in less than a second or a few seconds in the worst case. Since the overhead is so little you can afford having more nodes of Manticore Search + the library than Elasticsearch. More nodes and quicker start means higher high availability and agility.
    4. powerful SQL for logs/metrics analytics and everything else [Manticore Search](https://github.com/manticoresoftware/manticoresearch) can give you

  - **manticoresearch** [📁](./manticoresearch) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/manticoresearch) -- Manticore Search is an easy to use open source fast database for search. Good alternative for Elasticsearch. What distinguishes it from other solutions is:
    
    * It's very fast and therefore more cost-efficient than alternatives, for example Manticore is:
    * Modern MPP architecture and smart query parallelization capabilities allow to fully utilize all your CPU cores to **lower response time** as much as possible, when needed.
    * Powerful and fast full-text search which **works fine for small and big datasets**
    * Traditional **row-wise storage** for small, medium and big size datasets
    * **Columnar storage** support via the [Manticore Columnar Library](https://github.com/manticoresoftware/columnar/) for bigger datasets (much bigger than can fit in RAM)
    * Easy to use secondary indexes (you don't need to create them manually)
    * Cost-based optimizer for search queries
    * SQL-first: Manticore's **native syntax is SQL**. It speaks SQL over HTTP and uses the MySQL protocol (you can use your preferred MySQL client)
    * **JSON over HTTP**: to provide a more programmatic way to manage your data and schemas, Manticore provides a HTTP JSON protocol
    * Written fully in C++: **starts fast, doesn't take much RAM**, and low-level optimizations provide good performance
    * **Real-time inserts**: after an INSERT is made, the document is accessible immediately
    * [Interactive courses](https://play.manticoresearch.com/) for **easier learning**
    * **Built-in replication and load balancing**
    * **Can sync** from MySQL/PostgreSQL/ODBC/xml/csv out of the box
    * Not fully ACID-compliant, but **supports transactions and binlog** for safe writes

  - **removed**; reason: we've decided to offer any application user facing scripting features in JavaScript only: Python and the others can use socket-based messaging when someone wants to write their user scripts in any of those languages.


The additional (and more important) reason to ditch CPython from the R&D set is hairiness of integrating Python into an application as an embedded scripting language, instead of the other way around. With the envisioned advent of ZeroMQ/socket based IPC, any Python scripts can hook into that instead of spending the effort and maintenance of having that large language as an embedded 'assistive' scripting/configuration language: it's simply too huge and complicated. We're not Blender and we don't have the funding.

- ~~**lua** [🌐](https://github.com/lua/lua)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: we've decided to offer any application user facing scripting features in JavaScript only: Python and the others can use socket-based messaging when someone wants to write their user scripts in any of those languages. See also the `CPython` entry.

- ~~**luaJIT** [🌐](https://github.com/LuaJIT/LuaJIT)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: see the `lua` entry above.

  Note: (older) Boost.Asio is also included in Boost.

- **backward-cpp** [📁](./backward-cpp) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/backward-cpp) -- a beautiful stack trace pretty printer for C++. Backward supports pretty printed stack traces on GNU/Linux, macOS and Windows.
- **binary_search** [📁](./binary_search) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/binary_search) -- includes both the most commonly used binary search variant, as first published by Hermann Bottenbruch in 1962, plus several novel variants with improved performance.

- **capture-thread** [📁](./capture-thread) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/capture-thread) -- framework for loggers, tracers, and mockers in multithreaded C++ programs. When developing C++ projects, [instrumentation][instrumentation] is frequently used to collect information from the system, inject information into the system, or both. The role of this information within the system rarely lines up with the actual structure of the project. This library is designed to handle all of these situations with minimal intrusion into your project, and without leaking details in your API. The **Capture Thread Library** is designed around the concept of thread-locality, which allows the sharing of static variables *only within the current thread*. Canonical static variables, on the other hand, are problematic due to ownership and thread-safety issues.
- **cfgpath** [📁](./cfgpath) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/cfgpath) -- cross platform methods for obtaining paths to configuration files
- **colorm** [📁](./colorm) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/colorm) -- ColorM is a C++11 header-only color conversion and manipulation library for [CSS colors](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/) with an API similar to [chroma.js](https://github.com/gka/chroma.js/)'s API.

- **coost** [📁](./coost) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/coost) -- A tiny boost library in C++11. `coost` (formerly known as `cocoyaxi`) is an elegant and efficient cross-platform C++ base library, it is not as heavy as `boost`, but still provides enough powerful features.
- **cppdap** [📁](./cppdap) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/cppdap) -- a C++11 library (["SDK"](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/implementors/sdks/)) implementation of the [Debug Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/), providing an API for implementing a DAP client or server. `cppdap` provides C++ type-safe structures for the full [DAP specification](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/specification), and provides a simple way to add custom protocol messages.

- **crumsort** [📁](./crumsort) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/crumsort) -- is a hybrid quicksort / mergesort algorithm. The sort is in-place, unstable, adaptive, branchless, and has exceptional performance.
- **delegate** [📁](./delegate) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/delegate) -- an embedded friendly alternative to `std::function`. The main purpose is to store callable things such as free functions, member functions, and functors. Once stored, the delegate can be called without knowledge of the type of stored thing. The `delegate` guarantees no heap allocation and [is `trivially_copyable`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/TriviallyCopyable). It will never throw exceptions itself. Intended use is as general callback storage (think function pointer analog). The price to pay is that the delegate only stores a pointer to referenced functor objects or objects to call member functions on. The user needs to handle the lifetime of a referred object. In addition, the delegation object has a smaller footprint compared to common `std::function` implementations, using only 2 pointers (free function pointer and void pointer). This is small enough so that a delegate will use small object optimization.
- **detect-character-encoding** [📁](./detect-character-encoding) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/detect-character-encoding) -- detect character encoding using [ICU](http://site.icu-project.org).  **Tip:** If you don’t need ICU in particular, consider using [ced](https://github.com/sonicdoe/ced), which is based on Google’s lighter [compact_enc_det](https://github.com/google/compact_enc_det) library.
- **expected** [📁](./expected) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/expected) -- a C++ single header implementation of `std::expected` with functional-style extensions. [`std::expected`](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0323r3.pdf) is proposed as the preferred way to represent object which will either have an expected value, or an unexpected value giving information about why something failed. Unfortunately, chaining together many computations which may fail can be verbose, as error-checking code will be mixed in with the actual programming logic. This implementation provides a number of utilities to make coding with `expected` cleaner.
- **fast_float** [📁](./fast_float) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/fast_float) -- fast and exact implementation of the C++ `from_chars` functions for float and double types: 4x faster than `strtod`
- **fastrange** [📁](./fastrange) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/fastrange) -- a fast alternative to the modulo reduction.

- **libcnl** [📁](./libcnl) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/cnl) -- The Compositional Numeric Library (CNL) is a C++ library of fixed-precision numeric classes which enhance integers to deliver safer, simpler, cheaper arithmetic types. CNL is particularly well-suited to: (1) compute on energy-constrained environments where FPUs are absent or costly; (2) compute on energy-intensive environments where arithmetic is the bottleneck such as simulations, machine learning applications and DSPs; and (3) domains such as finance where precision is essential.

- **lockfree** [📁](./lockfree) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/lockfree) -- a collection of lock-free data structures written in standard C++11 and suitable for all platforms - from deeply embedded to HPC.
- **memory** [📁](./memory) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/memory) -- the C++ STL allocator model has various flaws. For example, they are fixed to a certain type, because they are almost necessarily required to be templates. So you can't easily share a single allocator for multiple types. In addition, you can only get a copy from the containers and not the original allocator object. At least with C++11 they are allowed to be stateful and so can be made object not instance based. But still, the model has many flaws. Over the course of the years many solutions have been proposed, for example [EASTL]. This library is another. But instead of trying to change the STL, it works with the current implementation.
- **mesh-allocator** [📁](./mesh-allocator) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/Mesh) -- Mesh: Compacting Memory Management for C/C++ -- Mesh is a drop in replacement for [malloc(3)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/malloc.3.html) that can transparently recover from memory fragmentation without any changes to application code.

(2021).
- **piposort** [📁](./piposort) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/piposort) -- a stable top-down adaptive branchless merge sort named piposort. It is intended as a simplified [quadsort](https://github.com/scandum/quadsort) with reduced adaptivity, but a great reduction in lines of code and overall complexity. The name stands for ping-pong.

- **simdcomp** [📁](./simdcomp) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/simdcomp) -- SIMDComp is a simple C library for compressing lists of integers using binary packing and SIMD instructions. The assumption is either that you have a list of 32-bit integers where most of them are small, or a list of 32-bit integers where differences between successive integers are small. No software is able to reliably compress an array of 32-bit random numbers.
- **SIMDString** [📁](./SIMDString) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/SIMDString) -- a [MIT-licensed](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) open source implementation of a fast C++ string class designed for use in games. It is a drop-in replacement for `std::string` that is 10-100x faster for many common operations, such as small `string::operator+=(const char*)`, `string::string(const string&)`, `string::string(const char*)`, and `string::c_str()`.

SWIG simplifies development by largely automating the task of scripting language integration, allowing developers and users to focus on more important problems.
  
  *[SWIG 🌐](https://swig.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Manual/SWIG.html) was not considered initially; more suitable for RPC than what we have in mind, which is purely data messages enchange. MAY be of use for transitional applications which are mixed-(programming-)language based, e.g. where we want to mix C/C++ and C# in a single Test Application.*

- **wolfsort** [📁](./wolfsort) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/wolfsort) -- a stable adaptive hybrid bucket / quick / merge / drop sort named wolfsort. The bucket sort, forming the core of wolfsort, is not a comparison sort, so wolfsort can be considered a member of the radix-sort family. Quicksort and mergesort are well known. Dropsort gained popularity after it was reinvented as Stalin sort.
- **xcdat** [📁](./xcdat) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/xcdat) -- a C++17 header-only library of a fast compressed string dictionary based on an improved double-array trie structure described in the paper: [Compressed double-array tries for string dictionaries supporting fast lookup](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10115-016-0999-8), *Knowledge and Information Systems*, 2017, available [here](https://kampersanda.github.io/pdf/KAIS2017.pdf).

### multi-processing: Promise/A+

The key distinction between Promises/A+ and `std::promise` in C++11 is that Promises/A+ provides non-blocking synchronization (via chaining function objects) and `std::promise` provides blocking synchronization (or polling). Both have their uses and one is not a direct replacement for the other.

IMPORTANT NOTE: there is one major difference, though. Most modern Javascript promises (including JS Native promises) resolve asynchronously, i.e. their `resolve()` method does not directly call the `then()` handlers, but schedules the calls on the next message loop iteration. The same happens when a `then()`/`catch()` handler is attached to an already resolved/rejected promise. This may be a bit less efficient, but makes the behavior symmetric and more predictable. These libraries *SHOULD* resolve synchronously, because they are unaware of the message loop that is used in the application. (Look into task schedulers above for when you need such awareness, e.g. `taskflow`.)

- **nsync** [📁](./nsync) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/nsync) -- a C library that exports various synchronization primitives. `nsync` may be desirable in place of `pthread` primitives in some cases:  (1) nsync locks are reader-writer locks (but are as efficient as mutexes).  (2) nsync locks and condition variables occupy only two words each.  (3) nsync works on Unix-like systems and Windows.  It should be portable to other platforms straightforwardly.  (4) nsync provides conditional critical sections.  These fill the same role as condition variables, but are usually easier to use, and in most common cases are comparable in speed.  They can be easier to use in two ways:  (A) it's not necessary to surround the "wait" operation in a while loop; instead the condition is passed to the call as a function and arbitrary pointer argument.  (B) it's not necessary to wake or signal explicitly when the condition(s) become true; they are checked automatically. The primary downsides are:  (A) they are not available in most other common synchronization APIs, and so they may be unfamiliar (even though they date back to the 1960s), and (B) if threads routinely wait on many distinct, false conditions associated with the same lock, they may be slower than condition variables. In this case, clients can use condition variables in the normal way; conditional critical sections and condition variables can be used with the same lock.  (5) nsync waits can be cancelled via an object passed to the wait calls, unlike the pthread model in which threads are cancelled.  This difference can be useful if the computation needs multiple threads, or if cancellation affects only sub-operations within a larger operation by the thread.

- **pevents** [📁](./pevents) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/pevents) -- Win32 events for *nix/POSIX platforms, built on top of `pthreads`. `pevents` provides most of the functionality of both manual- and auto-reset events on Windows, most-notably including simultaneous waits on multiple events (à la `WaitForMultipleObjects`). `pevents` also doubles as a thin, sane wrapper for `CreateEvent()` & co. on Windows, meaning you can use `pevents` directly in your cross-platform code without `#ifdef`s for Windows/pthreads. While POSIX condition variables (pthread_cond_t) and WIN32 events both provide the essential building blocks of the synchronization primitives required to write multithreaded code with signaling, the nature of the differences between the two have lent their way towards creating different synchronization and multithreaded-programming paradigms. The only features not included are only named events and support for security attributes. To the author's best knowledge, this is the only implementation of WIN32 events available for Linux and other posix platforms that provides support for simultaneously waiting on multiple events. Depending on your needs, we've been told that pevents may be used as a lightweight alternative to libuv/libev while still allowing your code to embrace asynchronous event handling with ease.

  Currently, _libevent_ supports _[/dev/poll](http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E19253-01/816-5177/6mbbc4g9n/index.html)_, _[kqueue(2)](http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=kqueue&apropos=0&sektion=0&format=html)_, _[event ports](http://developers.sun.com/solaris/articles/event_completion.html)_, [POSIX _select(2)_](http://manpages.debian.net/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=select), [Windows _select()_](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms740141(v=vs.85).aspx), [_poll(2)_](http://manpages.debian.net/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=poll), and _[epoll(4)](http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/epoll.txt)_. The internal event mechanism is completely independent of the exposed event API, and a simple update of libevent can provide new functionality without having to redesign the applications. As a result, _Libevent_ allows for portable application development and provides the most scalable event notification mechanism available on an operating system. Libevent can also be used for multi-threaded applications, either by isolating each `event_base` so that only a single thread accesses it, or by locked access to a single shared `event_base`. _Libevent_ should compile on Linux, *BSD, Mac OS X, Solaris, Windows, and more.
  
  Libevent additionally provides a sophisticated framework for buffered network IO, with support for sockets, filters, rate-limiting, SSL, zero-copy file transmission, and IOCP. Libevent includes support for several useful protocols, including DNS, HTTP, and a minimal RPC framework.

The primary goal of enkiTS is to help developers create programs which handle both data and task level parallelism to utilize the full performance of multicore CPUs, whilst being lightweight (only a small amount of code) and easy to use.
  
  Features:
  
    - Braided parallelism - can issue tasks from another task as well as from the thread which created the Task System, and has a simple task interface for both data and task parallelism.
    - Can pin tasks to a given thread - can schedule a task which will only be run on the specified thread.
    - Can register external threads to use with enkiTS
    - Can set task priorities - Up to 5 task priorities can be configured via define ENKITS_TASK_PRIORITIES_NUM (defaults to 3). Higher priority tasks are run before lower priority ones.
    - Can wait for pinned tasks - useful for creating IO threads which do no other work.
    - Completion Actions - can perform an action on task completion. This avoids the expensive action of adding the task to the scheduler, and can be used to safely delete a completed task.
    - Dependencies - can set dependencies between tasks.
    - Fast, then scalable - designed for consumer devices first, so performance on a low number of threads is important, followed by scalability.
    - Lightweight
    - Up-front Allocation friendly - designed for zero allocations during scheduling.

That is, given the string "1.0e10", it should return a 64-bit floating-point value equal to 10000000000. We do not sacrifice accuracy. The function will match exactly (down the smallest bit) the result of a standard function like `strtod`.

- **tomlpp** [📁](./tomlpp) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/tomlplusplus) -- TOML++











### YAML

- **libcyaml** [📁](./libcyaml) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/libcyaml) -- a C library for reading and writing structured YAML documents. The fundamental idea behind CYAML is to allow applications to construct schemas which describe both the permissible structure of the YAML documents to read/write, and the C data structure(s) in which the loaded data is arranged in memory.
- **libfyaml** [📁](./libfyaml) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/libfyaml) -- a fancy 1.2 YAML and JSON parser/writer.

No string copies or duplications are done, and no virtual functions are used. The data tree is a flat index-based structure stored in a single array. Serialization happens only at your direct request, after parsing / before emitting. Internally, the data tree representation stores only string views and has no knowledge of types, but of course, every node can have a YAML type tag. `ryml` makes it easy and fast to read and modify the data tree.
- **yaml-cpp** [📁](./yaml-cpp) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/yaml-cpp) -- a YAML parser and emitter in C++ matching the YAML 1.2 spec.

- **Criterion** [📁](./Criterion) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/Criterion) -- a dead-simple, yet extensible, C and C++ unit testing framework.
- **cxxtest** [📁](./cxxtest) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/cxxtest) -- a unit testing framework for C++ that is similar in spirit to JUnit, CppUnit, and xUnit. CxxTest is easy to use because it does not require precompiling a CxxTest testing library, it employs no advanced features of C++ (e.g. RTTI) and it supports a very flexible form of test discovery.
- **cxxtest_catch_2_gtest** [📁](./cxxtest_catch_2_gtest) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/cxxtest_catch_2_gtest) -- quick & dirty converter from various test suites to googletest, i.e. allows us to use a single test framework, despite some libraries having been set up to use another, e.g. [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2).
- **doctest** [📁](./doctest) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/doctest) -- a C++ testing framework, by far the fastest both in compile times (by [**orders of magnitude**](doc/markdown/benchmarks.md)) and runtime compared to other feature-rich alternatives.

- **radamsa** [📁](./radamsa) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/radamsa) -- Radamsa is a test case generator for robustness testing, a.k.a. a fuzzer. It is typically used to test how well a program can withstand malformed and potentially malicious inputs. It works by reading sample files of valid data and generating interestingly different outputs from them. The main selling points of radamsa are that it has already found a slew of bugs in programs that actually matter, it is easily scriptable and easy to get up and running.
- **resumable-assert** [📁](./resumable-assert) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/resumable-assert) -- `assert` replacement to continue execution in debugger. In any large app, it sometimes happens that some asserts are failing in code you don't currently care about, and blocking the entire team from being able to run the app until the issue is fixed is not the best workflow. So we usually end up moving the execution marker past the assert line in IDE or debugger, or even comment the assert out, recompile and relaunch. With Resumable Assert, you can simply continue execution when an assertion fails in debugger, or even disable asserts that you are not interested in, so that those never bother you again.
- **Verify** [📁](./Verify) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/Verify) -- a snapshot tool that simplifies the assertion of complex data models and documents. Verify is called on the test result during the assertion phase. It serializes that result and stores it in a file that matches the test name. On the next test execution, the result is again serialized and compared to the existing file. The test will fail if the two snapshots do not match: either the change is unexpected, or the reference snapshot needs to be updated to the new result.











## logging & debugging

- **binlog** [📁](./binlog) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/binlog) -- a high performance C++ log library to produce structured binary logs.
- **breakpad** [📁](./breakpad) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/breakpad) -- a set of client and server components which implement a crash-reporting system.
  
  - **left-for-dead**; reason: nice idea, but slightly too GCC specific. has some GCC + Linux specific coding constructs: intrinsics + Linux-only API calls, which increase the cost of porting.

- **capture-thread** [📁](./capture-thread) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/capture-thread) -- framework for loggers, tracers, and mockers in multithreaded C++ programs. When developing C++ projects, [instrumentation][instrumentation] is frequently used to collect information from the system, inject information into the system, or both. The role of this information within the system rarely lines up with the actual structure of the project. This library is designed to handle all of these situations with minimal intrusion into your project, and without leaking details in your API. The **Capture Thread Library** is designed around the concept of thread-locality, which allows the sharing of static variables *only within the current thread*. Canonical static variables, on the other hand, are problematic due to ownership and thread-safety issues.
- **clp** [📁](./clp) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/clp) -- YScope's Compressed Log Processor (CLP) compresses your logs, and allows you to search the compressed logs without decompression.

In any large app, it sometimes happens that some asserts are failing in code you don't currently care about, and blocking the entire team from being able to run the app until the issue is fixed is not the best workflow. So we usually end up moving the execution marker past the assert line in IDE or debugger, or even comment the assert out, recompile and relaunch. With Resumable Assert, you can simply continue execution when an assertion fails in debugger, or even disable asserts that you are not interested in, so that those never bother you again.

- ~~**EasyLogger** [🌐](https://github.com/armink/EasyLogger) -- an ultra-lightweight (ROM<1.6K, RAM<0.3K), high-performance C/C++ log library, very suitable for resource-sensitive software projects. Compared with the well-known C/C++ log libraries such as log4c and zlog, EasyLogger has simpler functions and provides fewer interfaces to users, but it will be quick to get started. More practical functions support dynamic expansion in the form of plug-ins.~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: we've decided on using `glog` as the logging library for everything: while that one isn't perfect, most of the other stuff we've been looking at is using that one already and it matches our needs 80% of the time, while I'm okay with patching that library for the other 20% (syslog-like use, i.e. logging to localhost logging server where all logging is collected -- these log messages should travel across as part of the ZeroMQ message streams.)

- ~~**log4cplus** [🌐](https://github.com/log4cplus/log4cplus)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: we've decided on using `glog` as the logging library for everything. log4cplus, at the same time, is a tad too much. (I consider `log4j` et al *overdone* as it caters to every need instead of just providing those things as contrib code which can be integrated at need -- should not be as far run-time configurable as it currently is.)

- ~~**spdlog** [🌐](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: we've decided on using `glog` as the logging library for everything. `spdlog` has some nice features but in the end it was ease of cross-platform compilation and installed base that won out here...

- ~~**zlog** [🌐](https://github.com/HardySimpson/zlog)~~
  
  - **removed**; `zlog` has a nice overall design but is too 'Unix-is-the-world' in its coding: in the end it was ease of cross-platform compilation of `glog` that won the day and I'm okay with layering on top of that one to get the zlog category and other channel features, once I really need them.

- **nodesoup** [📁](./nodesoup) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/nodesoup) -- delivers graph untangling: a force-directed graph layout simulates forces to give motion to vertices and arrange them in a way that is visually pleasing and/or reveals structure. The Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm assigns a repelling force to vertices pair of the graph, effectively pushing apart vertices so they don't overlap, and a attraction force between each adjacent vertices pair, thus dragging closer connected vertices. The forces attenuate when the vertices get respectively further apart or closer, and a global temperature also serves as a simulated annealing, capping the maximum vertex displacement at each iteration. As the forces between each component and the temperature gradually diminish, the layout stabilizes.  Another method, the Kamada Kawai algorithm, relies on the simulation of springs between each vertex, which strength is determined by the length of the shortest path between both vertices. The potential energy of each vertex, i.e. the sum of the energy of all its springs, is then computed. The goal being to reduce the global energy of the layout, each vertex is moved step-by-step until its potential energy is considered low-enough, using a Newton-Raphson algorithm.

- **nodesoup** [📁](./nodesoup) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/nodesoup) -- delivers graph untangling: a force-directed graph layout simulates forces to give motion to vertices and arrange them in a way that is visually pleasing and/or reveals structure. The Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm assigns a repelling force to vertices pair of the graph, effectively pushing apart vertices so they don't overlap, and a attraction force between each adjacent vertices pair, thus dragging closer connected vertices. The forces attenuate when the vertices get respectively further apart or closer, and a global temperature also serves as a simulated annealing, capping the maximum vertex displacement at each iteration. As the forces between each component and the temperature gradually diminish, the layout stabilizes.  Another method, the Kamada Kawai algorithm, relies on the simulation of springs between each vertex, which strength is determined by the length of the shortest path between both vertices. The potential energy of each vertex, i.e. the sum of the energy of all its springs, is then computed. The goal being to reduce the global energy of the layout, each vertex is moved step-by-step until its potential energy is considered low-enough, using a Newton-Raphson algorithm.

- **OpenFST** [📁](./OpenFST) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/openfst) -- a library for constructing, combining, optimizing, and searching weighted finite-state transducers (FSTs). Weighted finite-state transducers are automata where each transition has an input label, an output label, and a weight. The more familiar finite-state acceptor is represented as a transducer with each transition's input and output label equal. Finite-state acceptors are used to represent sets of strings (specifically, regular or rational sets); finite-state transducers are used to represent binary relations between pairs of strings (specifically, rational transductions). The weights can be used to represent the cost of taking a particular transition. FSTs have key applications in speech recognition and synthesis, machine translation, optical character recognition, pattern matching, string processing, machine learning, information extraction and retrieval among others. Often a weighted transducer is used to represent a probabilistic model (e.g., an n-gram model, pronunciation model). FSTs can be optimized by determinization and minimization, models can be applied to hypothesis sets (also represented as automata) or cascaded by finite-state composition, and the best results can be selected by shortest-path algorithms.

Its primary advantage is that it's very thin and also non-recursive (uses multiple inheritance). std::tuple is usually implemented as a single inheritance hierarchy and as a result its layout can vary between compilers. Also it stores data in reverse order. Luple is built on multiple inheritance and its layout is consistent among compilers. It has the same layout as a non-virtual flat data structure with the same data members (formally luple is not a POD and we should keep that in mind when we reinterpret\_cast it). Luple can be used in constexpr functions if its data members are of literal type.   nuple extends luple and allows giving names to data members.   Struct Reader can detect and create a type list of the data member types of a flat data structure if they are literal, non-const/non-reference types. So, it's a form of primitive RTTI.

- **mechascribe** [📁](./mechascribe) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/mechascribe) -- a text rendering abstraction trying to support as much scripts as possible by combining the best publicly available libraries. Features support for complex text layout (using the `raqm` library), feature-complete rendering (using Freetype), very fast software rendering, modern 2-step CPU+GPU rendering, simplified distribution of the Noto fonts for extensive unicode coverage and completely independent font fallback management. The first step to supporting as much scripts as possible consists in gathering a set of fonts covering all the required glyphs. The Noto fonts were created by Google to solve this exact issue. The complete collection weights more than 1.5GiB, but keeping only the regular-weight variable-width sans-serif variants makes it only 74MiB. Zstd compression can help us reduce its size even further: using its most aggressive parameters, our set can be made to fit a 16MiB file. While the compression takes quite some time even on a powerful computer, the resulting archive still unpacks almost instantaneously.
- **merror** [📁](./merror) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/merror) -- **MError** C++ Macro Error Handling Library is a library for error handling in C++ without exceptions. It requires C++17 and only works for gcc or clang compilers.

- **u8_to_std_string** [📁](./u8_to_std_string) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/u8_to_std_string) -- C++ u8_to_std_string (`u8` and `char8_t` based string to `std::string`) inlines to convert between `u8` (`char8_t[]`) string constants and `char`-based `std::string` types to shut up C++17 ➜ C++20 transitioning codebases & compilers.
- **units** [📁](./units) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/units) -- the Units library provides a means of working with units of measurement at runtime, including conversion to and from strings. It provides a small number of types for working with units and measurements and operations necessary for user input and output with units.
- **unsmear** [📁](./unsmear) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/unsmear) -- converts precisely between timestamps in the timescale of [UTC with smeared leap seconds](https://developers.google.com/time/smear) and the unsmeared [TAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Time) and GPS timescales. This allows smeared time to be stored and distributed exclusively, then converted to and from other timescales in applications where the smear's 11.6 ppm frequency change is consequential. No parallel time distribution systems are required, nor is any mechanism necessary for a system to record what timescale its system clock is using. In other words, the smear is not a way of approximately smudging the clock; it is a defined, precise, and reversible conversion. Rather than having seconds of constant length and minutes with a variable number of seconds, there are always 60 seconds in a minute and the length of a second sometimes differs from those of TAI.

Colm is influenced primarily by [TXL](https://www.txl.ca/). Colm is not-your-typical-scripting-language™: Colm's main contribution lies in the parsing method. Colm's parsing engine is generalized, but it also allows for the construction of arbitrary global data structures that can be queried during parsing. In other generalized methods, construction of global data requires some very careful consideration because of inherent concurrency in the parsing method. It is such a tricky task that it is often avoided altogether and the problem is deferred to a post-parse disambiguation of the parse forest.

- **OpenSSL** [📁](./openssl) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/openssl) -- also used by cURL et al, incidentally.
- **pango** [📁](./pango) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/pango) -- a library for layout and rendering of text, with an emphasis on internationalization. Pango can be used anywhere that text layout is needed.
- **pcre** [📁](./pcre) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/pcre) -- PCRE2 : Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions. The PCRE2 library is a set of C functions that implement regular expression pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics as Perl 5. PCRE2 has its own native API, as well as a set of wrapper functions that correspond to the POSIX regular expression API. It comes in three forms, for processing 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit code units, in either literal or UTF encoding.
- **protobuf** [📁](./protobuf) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/protobuf) -- Protocol Buffers - Google's data interchange format that is a language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data.
  
  - **☹discouraged🤧**; reason: relatively slow run-time and (in my opinion) rather ugly & convoluted approach at build time. Has too much of a Java/CorporateProgramming smell, which has not lessened over the years, unfortunately.

- **ragel** [📁](./ragel) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/ragel) -- State Machine Compiler
- **re2c** [📁](./re2c) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/re2c) -- a lexer generator for C/C++, Go and Rust. Its main goal is generating fast lexers: at least as fast as their reasonably optimized hand-coded counterparts. Instead of using traditional table-driven approach, re2c encodes the generated finite state automata directly in the form of conditional jumps and comparisons. The resulting programs are faster and often smaller than their table-driven analogues, and they are much easier to debug and understand. re2c applies quite a few optimizations in order to speed up and compress the generated code.  Another distinctive feature is its flexible interface: instead of assuming a fixed program template, re2c lets the programmer write most of the interface code and adapt the generated lexer to any particular environment.
- **scintilla** [📁](./scintilla) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/scintilla) -- text editor (part of wxWidgets)

- ~~**Catch2** [🌐](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: we've decided to standardize on a single unittest library (which is well supported in Microsoft Visual Studio, including the Test Explorer view there); where necessary, we'll have to provide a translation layer instead when existing submodules use different test rigs originally.

Basically, you can think of AGG as of a rendering engine that produces pixel images in memory from some vectorial data.
- **aho_corasick** [📁](./aho_corasick) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/aho_corasick) -- a header only implementation of the Aho-Corasick pattern search algorithm invented by Alfred V. Aho and Margaret J. Corasick. It is a very efficient dictionary matching algorithm that can locate all search patterns against in input text simultaneously in O(n + m), with space complexity O(m) (where n is the length of the input text, and m is the combined length of the search patterns).
- **amd-fftw** [📁](./amd-fftw) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/amd-fftw) -- AOCL-FFTW is AMD optimized version of FFTW implementation targeted for AMD EPYC CPUs.

It also creates large read-only file-based data structures that are `mmap`-ped into memory so that many processes may share the same data. ANNOY is almost as fast as the fastest libraries, but what really sets Annoy apart is: it has the ability to use static files as indexes, enabling you to share an index across processes. ANNOY also decouples creating indexes from loading them, so you can pass around indexes as files and map them into memory quickly. ANNOY tries to minimize its memory footprint: the indexes are quite small. This is useful when you want to find nearest neighbors using multiple CPU's. Spotify uses ANNOY for music recommendations.
- **ApprovalTestsCpp** [📁](./ApprovalTestsCpp) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/ApprovalTests.cpp) -- Approval Tests for C++: also known as **Golden Master Tests** or **Snapshot Testing**, Approval Tests are an alternative to asserts.

- **baobzi** [📁](./baobzi) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/baobzi) -- an adaptive fast function approximator based on tree search. Word salad aside, `baobzi` is a tool to convert very CPU intensive function calculations into relatively cheap ones (at the cost of memory). This is similar to functions like `chebeval` in `MATLAB`, but can be significantly faster since the order of the polynomial fit can be much much lower to meet similar tolerances. It also isn't constrained for use only in `MATLAB`. Internally, `baobzi` represents your function by a grid of binary/quad/oct/N trees, where the leaves represent the function in some small sub-box of the function's domain with chebyshev polynomials. When you evaluate your function at a point with baobzi, it searches the tree for the box containing your point and evaluates using this approximant.

- **BCF-cuckoo-index** [📁](./BCF-cuckoo-index) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/BCF) -- Better Choice Cuckoo Filter (BCF) is an efficient approximate set representation data structure. Different from the standard Cuckoo Filter (CF), BCF leverages the principle of the power of two choices to select the better candidate bucket during insertion. BCF reduces the average number of relocations of the state-of-the-art CF by 35%.
  
  - **left-for-dead**; reason: has some GCC + Linux specific coding constructs: intrinsics + Linux-only API calls, which increase the cost of porting.

- **bebop** [📁](./bebop) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/bebop) -- an extremely simple, fast, efficient, cross-platform serialization format. Bebop is a schema-based binary serialization technology, similar to Protocol Buffers or MessagePack.

BehaviorTree.CPP features asynchronous Actions, reactive behaviors, execute multiple Actions concurrently (orthogonality), XML-based DSL scripts which can be loaded at run-time, i.e. the morphology of the Trees is _not_ hard-coded.
- **better-enums** [📁](./better-enums) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/better-enums) -- reflective compile-time enum library with clean syntax, in a single header file, and without dependencies. In C++11, *everything* can be used at compile time. You can convert your enums, loop over them, find their max, statically enforce conventions, and pass along the results as template arguments or to `constexpr` functions.

You can think about it like a mailbox for communication between application programs, where 'producer' drops a message in a mailbox and 'consumer' picks it up at its own leisure. Messages placed into the queue are stored until the recipient retrieves and processes them. In other words, producer and consumer applications can temporally and spatially isolate themselves from each other by using a message queue to facilitate communication.

- **cuckoofilter** [📁](./cuckoofilter) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/cuckoofilter) -- Cuckoo Filter is a Bloom filter replacement for approximated set-membership queries. While Bloom filters are well-known space-efficient data structures to serve queries like "if item x is in a set?", they do not support deletion. Their variances to enable deletion (like counting Bloom filters) usually require much more space. Cuckoo ﬁlters provide the ﬂexibility to add and remove items dynamically. A cuckoo filter is based on cuckoo hashing (and therefore named as cuckoo filter).  It is essentially a cuckoo hash table storing each key's fingerprint. Cuckoo hash tables can be highly compact, thus a cuckoo filter could use less space than conventional Bloom ﬁlters, for applications that require low false positive rates (< 3%).
- **cuckoo-index** [📁](./cuckoo-index) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/cuckoo-index) -- Cuckoo Index (CI) is a lightweight secondary index structure that represents the many-to-many relationship between keys and partitions of columns in a highly space-efficient way. CI associates variable-sized fingerprints in a Cuckoo filter with compressed bitmaps indicating qualifying partitions. The problem of finding all partitions that possibly contain a given lookup key is traditionally solved by maintaining one filter (e.g., a Bloom filter) per partition that indexes all unique key values contained in this partition. To identify all partitions containing a key, we would need to probe all per-partition filters (which could be many). Depending on the storage medium, a false positive there can be very expensive. Furthermore, secondary columns typically contain many duplicates (also across partitions). Cuckoo Index (CI) addresses these drawbacks of per-partition filters. (It must know all keys at build time, though.)

- **curl-www** [📁](./curl-www) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/curl-www) -- the curl.se web site contents.
- **CurvatureFilter** [📁](./CurvatureFilter) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/CurvatureFilter) -- Curvature filters are efficient solvers for variational models. Traditional solvers, such as gradient descent or Euler Lagrange Equation, start at the total energy and use diffusion scheme to carry out the minimization. When the initial condition is the original image, the data fitting energy always increases while the regularization energy always reduces during the optimization, as illustrated in the below figure. Thus, regularization energy must be the dominant part since the total energy has to decrease. Therefore, **Curvature filters focus on minimizing the regularization term,** whose minimizers are already known. For example, if the regularization is Gaussian curvature, the developable surfaces minimize this energy. Therefore, in curvature filter, developable surfaces are used to approximate the data. **As long as the decreased amount in the regularization part is larger than the increased amount in the data fitting energy, the total energy is reduced.**

- **delegate** [📁](./delegate) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/delegate) -- an embedded friendly alternative to `std::function`. The main purpose is to store callable things such as free functions, member functions, and functors. Once stored, the delegate can be called without knowledge of the type of stored thing. The `delegate` guarantees no heap allocation and [is `trivially_copyable`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/TriviallyCopyable). It will never throw exceptions itself. Intended use is as general callback storage (think function pointer analog). The price to pay is that the delegate only stores a pointer to referenced functor objects or objects to call member functions on. The user needs to handle the lifetime of a referred object. In addition, the delegation object has a smaller footprint compared to common `std::function` implementations, using only 2 pointers (free function pointer and void pointer). This is small enough so that a delegate will use small object optimization.

EigenRand is a header-only library for [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page), providing vectorized random number engines and vectorized random distribution generators.  Since the classic Random functions of Eigen rely on an old C function `rand()`, there is no way to control random numbers and no guarantee for quality of generated numbers. In addition, Eigen's Random is slow because `rand()` is hard to vectorize. EigenRand provides a variety of random distribution functions similar to C++11 standard's random functions, which can be vectorized and easily integrated into Eigen's expressions of Matrix and Array.

  Features:
  
    - Braided parallelism - can issue tasks from another task as well as from the thread which created the Task System, and has a simple task interface for both data and task parallelism.
    - Can pin tasks to a given thread - can schedule a task which will only be run on the specified thread.
    - Can register external threads to use with enkiTS
    - Can set task priorities - Up to 5 task priorities can be configured via define ENKITS_TASK_PRIORITIES_NUM (defaults to 3). Higher priority tasks are run before lower priority ones.
    - Can wait for pinned tasks - useful for creating IO threads which do no other work.
    - Completion Actions - can perform an action on task completion. This avoids the expensive action of adding the task to the scheduler, and can be used to safely delete a completed task.
    - Dependencies - can set dependencies between tasks.
    - Fast, then scalable - designed for consumer devices first, so performance on a low number of threads is important, followed by scalability.
    - Lightweight
    - Up-front Allocation friendly - designed for zero allocations during scheduling.

In practice, such container can outperform searching in sorted arrays, like `boost::flat_map`, due to less cache misses made in a lookup process. In comparison with RB-based trees, like `std::map`, lookup in Eytzinger map can be multiple times faster. Some comparison graphs are [given here](https://kazakov.life/2017/03/06/cache-friendly-associative-container/).

See also the PVLDB paper https://github.com/cwida/fsst/raw/master/fsstcompression.pdf. FSST is a compression scheme focused on string/text data: it can compress strings from distributions with many different values (i.e. where dictionary compression will not work well). It allows *random-access* to compressed data: it is not block-based, so individual strings can be decompressed without touching the surrounding data in a compressed block. When compared to e.g. LZ4 (which is block-based), FSST further achieves similar decompression speed and compression speed, and better compression ratio. FSST encodes strings using a symbol table -- but it works on pieces of the string, as it maps "symbols" (1-8 byte sequences) onto "codes" (single-bytes). FSST can also represent a byte as an exception (255 followed by the original byte). Hence, compression transforms a sequence of bytes into a (supposedly shorter) sequence of codes or escaped bytes. These shorter byte-sequences could be seen as strings again and fit in whatever your program is that manipulates strings. An optional 0-terminated mode (like, C-strings) is also supported.

The original GIF codecs were written for a much different world and took great pains to use as little memory as possible and to accommodate a slow and unreliable input stream of data. Those constraints are no longer a problem for the vast majority of users and they were hurting the performance. Another feature holding back the performance of the original GIFLIB was that the original codec was designed to work with image data a line at a time and used a separate LZW dictionary to manage the strings of repeating symbols. My codec uses the output image as the dictionary; this allows much faster 'unwinding' of the codes since they are all stored in the right direction to just be copied to the new location.

Indexed data is treated on a per-version/per-revision basis, i.e. existing data version/revision is never modified and updates/removals are treated as new versions/revisions of the said data. This allows for trivial multi-threaded read/write operations on the index. The index exposes its data processing functionality via a multi-threaded 'writer' interface that treats each document abstraction as a collection of fields to index and/or store. The index exposes its data retrieval functionality via 'reader' interface that returns records from an index matching a specified query. The queries themselves are constructed query trees built directly using the query building blocks available in the API. The querying infrastructure provides the capability of ordering the result set by one or more ranking/scoring implementations. The ranking/scoring implementation logic is plugin-based and lazy-initialized during runtime as needed, allowing for addition of custom ranking/scoring logic without the need to even recompile the IResearch library.

However, Jim Tcl offers a number of both Tcl8.5 and Tcl8.6 features ({*}, dict, lassign, tailcall and optional UTF-8 support) and some unique features. These unique features include [lambda] with garbage collection, a general GC/references system, arrays as syntax sugar for [dict]tionaries, object-based I/O and more. Other common features of the Tcl programming language are present, like the "everything is a string" behaviour, implemented internally as dual ported objects to ensure that the execution time does not reflect the semantic of the language :)

  Currently, _libevent_ supports _[/dev/poll](http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E19253-01/816-5177/6mbbc4g9n/index.html)_, _[kqueue(2)](http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=kqueue&apropos=0&sektion=0&format=html)_, _[event ports](http://developers.sun.com/solaris/articles/event_completion.html)_, [POSIX _select(2)_](http://manpages.debian.net/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=select), [Windows _select()_](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms740141(v=vs.85).aspx), [_poll(2)_](http://manpages.debian.net/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=poll), and _[epoll(4)](http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/epoll.txt)_. The internal event mechanism is completely independent of the exposed event API, and a simple update of libevent can provide new functionality without having to redesign the applications. As a result, _Libevent_ allows for portable application development and provides the most scalable event notification mechanism available on an operating system. Libevent can also be used for multi-threaded applications, either by isolating each `event_base` so that only a single thread accesses it, or by locked access to a single shared `event_base`. _Libevent_ should compile on Linux, *BSD, Mac OS X, Solaris, Windows, and more.
  
  Libevent additionally provides a sophisticated framework for buffered network IO, with support for sockets, filters, rate-limiting, SSL, zero-copy file transmission, and IOCP. Libevent includes support for several useful protocols, including DNS, HTTP, and a minimal RPC framework.

- **libics** [📁](./libics) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/libics) -- the reference library for ICS (Image Cytometry Standard), an open standard for writing images of any dimensionality and data type to file, together with associated information regarding the recording equipment or recorded subject.
  
  ICS stands for Image Cytometry Standard, and was first proposed in: P. Dean, L. Mascio, D. Ow, D. Sudar, J. Mullikin, "Propsed standard for image cytometry data files", Cytometry, n.11, pp.561-569, 1990. 
  
  It writes 2 files, one is the header, with an '.ics' extension, and the other is the actual image data (with an '.ids' extension.)
  
  ICS version 2.0 extends this standard to allow for a more versatile placement of the image data. It can now be placed either in the same '.ics' file or inbedded in any other file, by specifying the file name and the byte offset for the data.
  
  The advantage of ICS over other open standards such as TIFF is that it allows data of any type and dimensionality to be stored. A TIFF file can contain a collection of 2D images; it's up to the user to determine how these relate to each other. An ICS file can contain, for exmaple, a 5D image in which the 4th dimension is the light frequency and the 5th time. Also, all of the information regarding the microscope settings (or whatever instument was used to acquire the image) and the sample preparation can be included in the file.

  SQLite has solidified its place in modern technology stacks, embedded in nearly any computing device you can think of. Its open source nature and public domain availability make it a popular choice for modification to meet specific use cases.
  But despite having its code available, SQLite famously doesn't accept external contributors, so community improvements cannot be widely enjoyed.
  There have been other forks in the past, but they all focus on a specific technical difference. We aim to be a community where people can contribute from many different angles and motivations.
  We want to see a world where everyone can benefit from all of the great ideas and hard work that the SQLite community contributes back to the codebase.

- **luple** [📁](./luple) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/luple) -- provides C++ Type Loophole, luple, nuple, C++ String Interning, Struct Reader. Luple is a tuple-like data structure. Its primary advantage is that it's very thin and also non-recursive (uses multiple inheritance). std::tuple is usually implemented as a single inheritance hierarchy and as a result its layout can vary between compilers. Also it stores data in reverse order. Luple is built on multiple inheritance and its layout is consistent among compilers. It has the same layout as a non-virtual flat data structure with the same data members (formally luple is not a POD and we should keep that in mind when we reinterpret\_cast it). Luple can be used in constexpr functions if its data members are of literal type.   nuple extends luple and allows giving names to data members.   Struct Reader can detect and create a type list of the data member types of a flat data structure if they are literal, non-const/non-reference types. So, it's a form of primitive RTTI.

  1. log analytics including rich free text search capabities (which is missing in e.g. [Clickhouse](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse) - great tool for metrics analytics)
  2. faster / low resource consumption log/metrics analytics. Since the library and Manticore Search are both written in C++ with low optimizations in mind, in many cases the performance / RAM consumption is better than in Lucene / SOLR / Elasticsearch
  3. running log / metric analytics in docker / kubernetes. Manticore Search + the library can work with as little as 30 megabytes of RAM which Elasticsearch / Clickhouse can't. It also starts in less than a second or a few seconds in the worst case. Since the overhead is so little you can afford having more nodes of Manticore Search + the library than Elasticsearch. More nodes and quicker start means higher high availability and agility.

  * Powerful and fast full-text search which **works fine for small and big datasets**
  * Traditional **row-wise storage** for small, medium and big size datasets
  * **Columnar storage** support via the [Manticore Columnar Library](https://github.com/manticoresoftware/columnar/) for bigger datasets (much bigger than can fit in RAM)
  * Easy to use secondary indexes (you don't need to create them manually)
  * Cost-based optimizer for search queries
  * SQL-first: Manticore's **native syntax is SQL**. It speaks SQL over HTTP and uses the MySQL protocol (you can use your preferred MySQL client)
  * **JSON over HTTP**: to provide a more programmatic way to manage your data and schemas, Manticore provides a HTTP JSON protocol
  * Written fully in C++: **starts fast, doesn't take much RAM**, and low-level optimizations provide good performance
  * **Real-time inserts**: after an INSERT is made, the document is accessible immediately
  * [Interactive courses](https://play.manticoresearch.com/) for **easier learning**
  * **Built-in replication and load balancing**
  * **Can sync** from MySQL/PostgreSQL/ODBC/xml/csv out of the box

- **mechascribe** [📁](./mechascribe) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/mechascribe) -- a text rendering abstraction trying to support as much scripts as possible by combining the best publicly available libraries. Features support for complex text layout (using the `raqm` library), feature-complete rendering (using Freetype), very fast software rendering, modern 2-step CPU+GPU rendering, simplified distribution of the Noto fonts for extensive unicode coverage and completely independent font fallback management. The first step to supporting as much scripts as possible consists in gathering a set of fonts covering all the required glyphs. The Noto fonts were created by Google to solve this exact issue. The complete collection weights more than 1.5GiB, but keeping only the regular-weight variable-width sans-serif variants makes it only 74MiB. Zstd compression can help us reduce its size even further: using its most aggressive parameters, our set can be made to fit a 16MiB file. While the compression takes quite some time even on a powerful computer, the resulting archive still unpacks almost instantaneously.

- **memory** [📁](./memory) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/memory) -- the C++ STL allocator model has various flaws. For example, they are fixed to a certain type, because they are almost necessarily required to be templates. So you can't easily share a single allocator for multiple types. In addition, you can only get a copy from the containers and not the original allocator object. At least with C++11 they are allowed to be stateful and so can be made object not instance based. But still, the model has many flaws. Over the course of the years many solutions have been proposed, for example [EASTL]. This library is another. But instead of trying to change the STL, it works with the current implementation.

  One of the highlights is a state-of-the-art scheduler using column generation, which significantly outperforms all other optimizers at [schedulingbenchmarks.org](http://www.schedulingbenchmarks.org/). **Try it in the browser (wasm) [here](https://www.strandmark.net/wasm/shift_scheduling_colgen_page.html)!**
  
  Implements the algorithm described in [_First-order Linear Programming in a Column Generation-Based Heuristic Approach to the Nurse Rostering Problem_](https://www.strandmark.net/papers/first-order-scheduling.pdf) (2020) [doi link](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cor.2020.104945).
  
  The `minimum::linear::colgen` module contains code for solving scheduling problems. It significantly outperforms all other optimizers at [schedulingbenchmarks.org](http://www.schedulingbenchmarks.org/).
  
  Some of the reasons it is fast:
  
  - It uses a first-order LP solver based on papers by Chambolle and Pock.
  - The pricing problem uses highly optimized dynamic programming in a DAG (in `minimum::algorithms`).
  - The [Ryan-Foster rule](https://strandmark.wordpress.com/2018/01/24/visualizing-the-ryan-foster-rule/) is used to iteratively work towards an integer solution. There is no time to branch and bound for big problems.

- **morton_filter** [📁](./morton_filter) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/morton_filter) -- a [Morton filter](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol11/p1041-breslow.pdf) -- a new approximate set membership data structure. A Morton filter is a modified cuckoo filter that is optimized for bandwidth-constrained systems. Morton filters use additional computation in order to reduce their off-chip memory traffic. Like a cuckoo filter, a Morton filter supports insertions, deletions, and lookup operations. It additionally adds high-throughput self-resizing, a feature of quotient filters, which allows a Morton filter to increase its capacity solely by leveraging its internal representation. This capability is in contrast to existing vanilla cuckoo filter implementations, which are static and thus require using a backing data structure that contains the full set of items to resize the filter. Morton filters can also be configured to use less memory than a cuckoo filter for the same error rate while simultaneously delivering insertion, deletion, and lookup throughputs that are, respectively, up to 15.5x, 1.3x, and 2.5x higher than a cuckoo filter. Morton filters in contrast to vanilla cuckoo filters do not require a power of two number of buckets but rather only a number that is a multiple of two. They also use fewer bits per item than a Bloom filter when the target false positive rate is less than around 1% to 3%.

  In the offline phase of the algorithm MRPT indexes the data with a collection of *random projection trees*. In the online phase the index structure allows us to answer queries in superior time. A detailed description of the algorithm with the time and space complexities, and the aforementioned comparisons can be found in [our article](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ttonteri/pub/bigdata2016.pdf) that was published in IEEE International Conference on Big Data 2016.

- **nodesoup** [📁](./nodesoup) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/nodesoup) -- delivers graph untangling: a force-directed graph layout simulates forces to give motion to vertices and arrange them in a way that is visually pleasing and/or reveals structure. The Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm assigns a repelling force to vertices pair of the graph, effectively pushing apart vertices so they don't overlap, and a attraction force between each adjacent vertices pair, thus dragging closer connected vertices. The forces attenuate when the vertices get respectively further apart or closer, and a global temperature also serves as a simulated annealing, capping the maximum vertex displacement at each iteration. As the forces between each component and the temperature gradually diminish, the layout stabilizes.  Another method, the Kamada Kawai algorithm, relies on the simulation of springs between each vertex, which strength is determined by the length of the shortest path between both vertices. The potential energy of each vertex, i.e. the sum of the energy of all its springs, is then computed. The goal being to reduce the global energy of the layout, each vertex is moved step-by-step until its potential energy is considered low-enough, using a Newton-Raphson algorithm.

- **nsync** [📁](./nsync) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/nsync) -- a C library that exports various synchronization primitives. `nsync` may be desirable in place of `pthread` primitives in some cases:  (1) nsync locks are reader-writer locks (but are as efficient as mutexes).  (2) nsync locks and condition variables occupy only two words each.  (3) nsync works on Unix-like systems and Windows.  It should be portable to other platforms straightforwardly.  (4) nsync provides conditional critical sections.  These fill the same role as condition variables, but are usually easier to use, and in most common cases are comparable in speed.  They can be easier to use in two ways:  (A) it's not necessary to surround the "wait" operation in a while loop; instead the condition is passed to the call as a function and arbitrary pointer argument.  (B) it's not necessary to wake or signal explicitly when the condition(s) become true; they are checked automatically. The primary downsides are:  (A) they are not available in most other common synchronization APIs, and so they may be unfamiliar (even though they date back to the 1960s), and (B) if threads routinely wait on many distinct, false conditions associated with the same lock, they may be slower than condition variables. In this case, clients can use condition variables in the normal way; conditional critical sections and condition variables can be used with the same lock.  (5) nsync waits can be cancelled via an object passed to the wait calls, unlike the pthread model in which threads are cancelled.  This difference can be useful if the computation needs multiple threads, or if cancellation affects only sub-operations within a larger operation by the thread.

The more familiar finite-state acceptor is represented as a transducer with each transition's input and output label equal. Finite-state acceptors are used to represent sets of strings (specifically, regular or rational sets); finite-state transducers are used to represent binary relations between pairs of strings (specifically, rational transductions). The weights can be used to represent the cost of taking a particular transition. FSTs have key applications in speech recognition and synthesis, machine translation, optical character recognition, pattern matching, string processing, machine learning, information extraction and retrieval among others. Often a weighted transducer is used to represent a probabilistic model (e.g., an n-gram model, pronunciation model). FSTs can be optimized by determinization and minimization, models can be applied to hypothesis sets (also represented as automata) or cascaded by finite-state composition, and the best results can be selected by shortest-path algorithms.

Kimura, and Y. Ishibashi, "Randomized redundant DCT: Efficient denoising by using random subsampling of DCT patches," Proc. Siggraph Asia, Technical Brief, Nov. 2015. In this paper, the DCT-based denoising is accelerated by using a randomized algorithm. The DCT is based on the fastest algorithm and is SIMD vectorized by using SSE. Some modifications improve denoising performance in term of PSNR. The code is 100x faster than the OpenCV's implementation (cv::xphoto::dctDenoising) for the paper. Optionally, we can use DHT (discrete Walsh–Hadamard transform) for fast computation instead of using DCT.

- **rapidyaml** [📁](./rapidyaml) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/rapidyaml) -- *Rapid YAML*, or `ryml`, for short. ryml is a C++ library to parse and emit YAML, and do it fast, on everything from x64 to bare-metal chips without operating system. `ryml` parses both read-only and in-situ source buffers; the resulting data nodes hold only views to sub-ranges of the source buffer. No string copies or duplications are done, and no virtual functions are used. The data tree is a flat index-based structure stored in a single array. Serialization happens only at your direct request, after parsing / before emitting. Internally, the data tree representation stores only string views and has no knowledge of types, but of course, every node can have a YAML type tag. `ryml` makes it easy and fast to read and modify the data tree.

- **re2c** [📁](./re2c) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/re2c) -- a lexer generator for C/C++, Go and Rust. Its main goal is generating fast lexers: at least as fast as their reasonably optimized hand-coded counterparts. Instead of using traditional table-driven approach, re2c encodes the generated finite state automata directly in the form of conditional jumps and comparisons. The resulting programs are faster and often smaller than their table-driven analogues, and they are much easier to debug and understand. re2c applies quite a few optimizations in order to speed up and compress the generated code.  Another distinctive feature is its flexible interface: instead of assuming a fixed program template, re2c lets the programmer write most of the interface code and adapt the generated lexer to any particular environment.

Accepts Flex specifications. Generates reusable source code that is easy to understand. Introduces indent/dedent anchors, lazy quantifiers, functions for lex/syntax error reporting and more. Seamlessly integrates with Bison and other parsers.
  
  The RE/flex matcher tracks line numbers, column numbers, and indentations, whereas Flex does not (option `noyylineno`) and neither do the other regex matchers (except PCRE2 and Boost.Regex when used with RE/flex).
  Tracking this information incurs some overhead. RE/flex also automatically decodes UTF-8/16/32 input and accepts `std::istream`, strings, and wide strings as input.
  
  RE/flex runs equally fast or slightly faster than the best times of Flex.

In any large app, it sometimes happens that some asserts are failing in code you don't currently care about, and blocking the entire team from being able to run the app until the issue is fixed is not the best workflow. So we usually end up moving the execution marker past the assert line in IDE or debugger, or even comment the assert out, recompile and relaunch. With Resumable Assert, you can simply continue execution when an assertion fails in debugger, or even disable asserts that you are not interested in, so that those never bother you again.

The Robots Exclusion Protocol (REP) is a standard that enables website owners to control which URLs may be accessed by automated clients (i.e. crawlers) through a simple text file with a specific syntax. It's one of the basic building blocks of the internet as we know it and what allows search engines to operate. Because the REP was only a de-facto standard for the past 25 years, different implementers implement parsing of robots.txt slightly differently, leading to confusion. This project aims to fix that by releasing the parser that Google uses.

- **sac** [📁](./sac) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/sac) -- a state-of-the-art lossless audio compression model. Lossless audio compression is a complex problem, because PCM data is highly non-stationary and uses high sample resolution (typically >=16bit). That's why classic context modelling suffers from context dilution problems. Sac employs a simple OLS-NLMS predictor per frame including bias correction. Prediction residuals are encoded using a sophisticated bitplane coder including SSE and various forms of probability estimations. Meta-parameters of the predictor are optimized via binary search (or [DDS](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2005WR004723)) on by-frame basis. This results in a highly asymmetric codec design. We throw a lot of muscles at the problem and archive only little gains - by practically predicting noise.

- **scws-chinese-word-segmentation** [📁](./scws-chinese-word-segmentation) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/scws) -- SCWS (Simple Chinese Word Segmentation) (i.e.: Simple Chinese Word Segmentation System). This is a mechanical Chinese word segmentation engine based on word frequency dictionary, which can basically correctly segment a whole paragraph of Chinese text into words. A word is the smallest morpheme unit in Chinese, but when writing, it does not separate words with spaces like English, so how to segment words accurately and quickly has always been a difficult problem in Chinese word segmentation.

  There are not many innovative elements in the word segmentation algorithm. It uses a word frequency dictionary collected by itself, supplemented by certain proper names, names of people, and place names. Basic word segmentation is achieved by identifying rules such as digital age. After small-scale testing, the accuracy is between 90% and 95%, which can basically satisfy some use in small search engines, keyword extraction and other occasions. The first prototype version was released in late 2005.

- **Shifted-Hamming-Distance** [📁](./Shifted-Hamming-Distance) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/Shifted-Hamming-Distance) -- Shifted Hamming Distance (SHD) is an edit-distance based filter that can quickly check whether the minimum number of edits (including insertions, deletions and substitutions) between two strings is smaller than a user defined threshold **T** (the number of allowed edits between the two strings).  Testing if two stings differs by a small amount is a prevalent function that is used in many applications. One of its biggest usage, perhaps, is in DNA or protein mapping, where a short DNA or protein string is compared against an enormous database, in order to find similar matches. In such applications, a query string is usually compared against multiple candidate strings in the database. Only candidates that are similar to the query are considered **matches** and recorded.  SHD expands the basic Hamming distance computation, which only detects substitutions, into a full-fledged edit-distance filter, which counts not only substitutions but **insertions and deletions** as well.
- **shmdata** [📁](./shmdata) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/shmdata) -- shares streams of framed data between processes (1 writer to many readers) via shared memory.

- **SipHash** [📁](./SipHash) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/SipHash) -- SipHash is a family of pseudorandom functions (PRFs) optimized for speed on short messages. This is the reference C code of SipHash: portable, simple, optimized for clarity and debugging. SipHash was designed in 2012 by [Jean-Philippe Aumasson](https://aumasson.jp) and [Daniel J. Bernstein](https://cr.yp.to) as a defense against [hash-flooding DoS attacks](https://aumasson.jp/siphash/siphashdos_29c3_slides.pdf).
  
  It is *simpler and faster* on short messages than previous cryptographic algorithms, such as MACs based on universal hashing, *competitive in performance* with insecure non-cryptographic algorithms, such as [fhhash](https://github.com/cbreeden/fxhash), *cryptographically secure*, with no sign of weakness despite multiple [cryptanalysis](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/865) [projects](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/865) by leading cryptographers, *battle-tested*, with successful integration in OSs (Linux kernel, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, FreeRTOS), languages (Perl, Python, Ruby, etc.), libraries (OpenSSL libcrypto, Sodium, etc.) and applications (Wireguard, Redis, etc.).
  
  As a secure pseudorandom function (a.k.a. keyed hash function), SipHash can also be used as a secure message authentication code (MAC). But SipHash is *not a hash* in the sense of general-purpose key-less hash function such as BLAKE3 or SHA-3. SipHash should therefore always be used with a secret key in order to be secure.

- **siridb-server** [📁](./siridb-server) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/siridb-server) -- SiriDB Server is a highly-scalable, robust and super fast time series database.

Upon insertion, a key is returned that can be used to later access or remove the values. Insertion, removal, and access are all guaranteed to take `O(1)` time (best, worst, and average case). Great for storing collections of objects that need stable, safe references but have no clear ownership. The difference between a `std::unordered_map` and a `dod::slot_map` is that the slot map generates and returns the key when inserting a value. A key is always unique and will only refer to the value that was inserted.

With STL::Cache you could put enormous (really unlimited) amount of data into it, but it will store only some small part of your data. So re-usable data will be kept near your code and not so popular data will not spend expensive memory. STL::Cache uses configurable policies, for decisions, whether data are good, to be kept in cache or they should be thrown away. It is shipped with 8 policies and you are free to implement your own.

No parallel time distribution systems are required, nor is any mechanism necessary for a system to record what timescale its system clock is using. In other words, the smear is not a way of approximately smudging the clock; it is a defined, precise, and reversible conversion. Rather than having seconds of constant length and minutes with a variable number of seconds, there are always 60 seconds in a minute and the length of a second sometimes differs from those of TAI.

At the same time there is a plethora of alternatives ranging from XML over Universal Binary JSON, MongoDB's BSON, MessagePack, BJSON (binary JSON), Apache Thrift till Google's protocol buffers and ArangoDB's shaped JSON. When looking into this, we were surprised to find that none of these formats manages to combine compactness, platform independence, fast access to sub-objects and rapid conversion from and to JSON.

So why use it then? What makes xmunch different from the other tools is the ability to extend incomplete word-lists. For hunspell's munch to identify a stem and add an affix mark, every word formed by the affix with the stem has to be in the original word-list. This makes sense for a compression tool. However if your word list is incomplete, you have to add all possible word-forms of a word first, before any compression is done. Using xmunch instead, you can define a subset of forms which are required to be in the word-list to allow the word to be used as stem. Like this, you can extend the word-list.

Modest resource requirements and simplicity make XOR [scapegoat trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapegoat_tree) stand out of the [BST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree) crowd. All iterators (except `end()` iterators), but not references and pointers, are invalidated, after inserting or erasing from this XOR [scapegoat tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapegoat_tree) implementation. You can dereference invalidated iterators, if they were not erased, but you cannot iterate with them. `end()` iterators are constant and always valid, but dereferencing them results in undefined behavior.

  **When updating multiple citations in a batch, it may happen that citation queries are blocked by Google Scholar for multiple automated requests. If a blockage happens, the add-on opens a browser window and directs it to http://scholar.google.com/, where you should see a Captcha displayed by Google Scholar, which you need to enter to get unblocked and then re-try updating the citations. It may happen that Google Scholar displays a message like the following "*We're sorry... but your computer or network may be sending automated queries. To protect our users, we can't process your request right now.*" In that case, the only solution is to wait for a while until Google unblocks you.**

  - **optional**; reason: considered *overkill* for the projects I'm currently involved in, including Qiqqa. Those can use [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/), [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) or other thirdparty pipelines to convert to & from supported formats.

- **OpenImageIO** [🌐](https://github.com/OpenImageIO/oiio) -- a library for reading, writing, and processing images in a wide variety of file formats, using a format-agnostic API, aimed at VFX applications.
  
  - **tentative/pending**; reason: considered nice & cool but still *overkill*. Qiqqa tooling can use [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/), [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) or other thirdparty pipelines to convert to & from supported formats.

- ~~**circlehash** [📁](./circlehash) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/circlehash) -- a family of non-cryptographic hash functions that pass every test in SMHasher.~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: written in Go; port to C/C++ is easy but just too much effort for too little gain; when we're looking for *fast* non-cryptographic hashes like this, we don't it to include 128-bit / 64-bit multiplications as those are generally slower than shift, add, xor. While this will surely be a nice hash, it doesn't fit our purposes.

- ~~**cpuinfo** [📁](./cpuinfo) [🌐](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/cpuinfo) -- CPU & hardware info~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: Linux-only, non-portable, deemed unsuitable for our needs.

- ~~**binary_bakery** [🌐](https://github.com/s9w/binary_bakery) -- resource compiler-like tool: embed any data in your C/C++ application~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: we already have `bin2coff` from MuPDF, which serves this purpose well enough.

- ~~**bzip2** [🌐](https://github.com/nemequ/bzip2)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: see `lzo` below. When we want this, we can go through [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/) or other thirdparty pipelines.

- ~~**Catch2** [🌐](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: we've decided to standardize on a single unittest library (which is well supported in Microsoft Visual Studio, including the Test Explorer view there); where necessary, we'll have to provide a translation layer instead when existing submodules use different test rigs originally.

- ~~**cgohlke::imagecodecs** [🌐](https://github.com/cgohlke/imagecodecs) (*not included; see also DICOM slot above*)~~
- ~~**clippson** [🌐](https://github.com/heavywatal/clippson) -- commandline parser + JSON data diagnostical dumper~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: deemed cool but unsuitable for our needs. Besides, we intend to use `cli11` instead of `clipp` for that library is easier to read and support is more active there.

- ~~**cpu_features** [🌐](https://github.com/google/cpu_features)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: Linux-only, non-portable, deemed unsuitable for our needs.

- ~~**cpu_stat** [🌐](https://github.com/vivaladav/cpu-stat)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: Linux-only, non-portable, deemed unsuitable for our needs.

- ~~**CPython** [🌐](https://github.com/python/cpython)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: we've decided to offer any application user facing scripting features in JavaScript only: Python and the others can use socket-based messaging when someone wants to write their user scripts in any of those languages.

- ~~[DICOM to NIfTI](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix) (*not included; see also DICOM slot above*)~~
- ~~**docopt** [🌐](https://github.com/docopt/docopt.cpp) -- generate documentation for command line options~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: deemed cool but unsuitable for our needs. We intend to use `cli11` instead.

- ~~**EasyLogger** [🌐](https://github.com/armink/EasyLogger) -- an ultra-lightweight (ROM<1.6K, RAM<0.3K), high-performance C/C++ log library, very suitable for resource-sensitive software projects. Compared with the well-known C/C++ log libraries such as log4c and zlog, EasyLogger has simpler functions and provides fewer interfaces to users, but it will be quick to get started. More practical functions support dynamic expansion in the form of plug-ins.~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: we've decided on using `glog` as the logging library for everything: while that one isn't perfect, most of the other stuff we've been looking at is using that one already and it matches our needs 80% of the time, while I'm okay with patching that library for the other 20% (syslog-like use, i.e. logging to localhost logging server where all logging is collected -- these log messages should travel across as part of the ZeroMQ message streams.)

- ~~**FastBinaryEncoding** [🌐](https://github.com/chronoxor/FastBinaryEncoding)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: for binary format record serialization we will be using `bebop` exclusively. All other communications will be JSON/JSON5/XML based.

- ~~**flatbuffers** [🌐](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: see `protobuf`: same smell rising. Faster at run time, but still a bit hairy to my tastes while `bebop` et al are on to something *potentially nice*.

- ~~**flatcc** [🌐](https://github.com/dvidelabs/flatcc)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: see `flatbuffers`. When we don't dig `flatbuffers`, then `flatcc` is automatically pretty useless to us. Let's rephrase that professionally: "`flatcc` has moved out of scope for our project."

- ~~**GDCM-Grassroots-DICOM** [🌐](https://github.com/malaterre/GDCM)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: not a frequently used format; the filter codes can be found in other libraries. *Overkill*. Qiqqa tooling can use [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/), [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) or other thirdparty pipelines to convert to & from supported formats.

- ~~**gmime** [🌐](https://github.com/jstedfast/gmime) (alternative repo [here](https://github.com/GNOME/gmime)) -- multipart MIME library; serves as a fundamental building block for full MHTML file format I/O support~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: GNOME libraries are horrible to integrate with other codebases.

- ~~**HDF5** [🌐](https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf5)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: HDF5 is a nice concept but considered *overkill* right now; where we need disk stores, we'll be using SQLite or LMDB-like key-value stores instead. Such stores are not meant to be interchangeable with other software in their raw shape and we'll provide public access APIs instead, where applicable.

- ~~**HighFive-HDF5** [🌐](https://github.com/BlueBrain/HighFive)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: see the `HDF5` entry above.

- ~~**ice** [🌐](https://github.com/zeroc-ice/ice) -- Comprehensive RPC Framework: helps you network your software with minimal effort.~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: has a strong focus on the *remote*, i.e. `R` in `RPC` (thus a focus on things such as encryption, authentication, firewalling, etc.), which we don't want or need: all services are supposed to run on a single machine and comms go through `localhost` *only*. When folks find they need to distribute the workload across multiple machines, then we'll be entering a new era in Qiqqa usage and then will be soon enough to (re-)investigate the usefulness of this package.

- ~~**inih** [🌐](https://github.com/benhoyt/inih)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: we've decided on using `libconfig` for configuration files.

- ~~**iniparser** [🌐](https://github.com/ndevilla/iniparser)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: we've decided on using `libconfig` for configuration files.

- ~~**libmicrohttpd** [🌐](https://github.com/Karlson2k/libmicrohttpd)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: we've decided on using `crow` as the main server framework. Second choices are `civetweb` and `h2o`. This GNU library is way too 'Unix-is-the-world' oriented for a smooth portable dev experience.

- ~~**libsmile** [🌐](https://github.com/pierre/libsmile) -- ["Smile" format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smile_%28data_interchange_format%29), i.e. a compact binary JSON format~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: for binary format record serialization we will be using `bebop` exclusively. All other communications will be JSON/JSON5/XML based.

- ~~**log4cplus** [🌐](https://github.com/log4cplus/log4cplus)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: we've decided on using `glog` as the logging library for everything. log4cplus, at the same time, is a tad too much. (I consider `log4j` et al *overdone* as it caters to every need instead of just providing those things as contrib code which can be integrated at need -- should not be as far run-time configurable as it currently is.)

- ~~**lua** [🌐](https://github.com/lua/lua)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: we've decided to offer any application user facing scripting features in JavaScript only: Python and the others can use socket-based messaging when someone wants to write their user scripts in any of those languages. See also the `CPython` entry.

- ~~**luaJIT** [🌐](https://github.com/LuaJIT/LuaJIT)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: see the `lua` entry above.

- ~~**lzo** [🌐](https://github.com/nemequ/lzo)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: gone as part of the first round of compression libraries' cleanup: we intend to support lz4 for fast work, plus zstd and *maybe* brotli for higher compression ratios, while we won't bother with anything else: the rest can be dealt with through [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/) or other thirdparty pipelines when we need to read (or write) them. See also: [7zip-Zstd](https://github.com/mcmilk/7-Zip-zstd), which is what I use for accessing almost all compressed material anywhere.

- ~~**lzsse** [🌐](https://github.com/ConorStokes/LZSSE)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: see `lzo` above. LZ4 either overtakes this one or is on par (anno 2022 AD) and I don't see a lot happening here, so the coolness factor is slowly fading...

- ~~**oatpp** [🌐](https://github.com/oatpp/oatpp) -- IPC / server framework~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: see `crow`. We have picked `crow` as the preferred way forward, so any similar/competing product is out of scope unless `crow` throws a tantrum on our test bench after all, the chances of that being *very slim*.

- ~~**pithy** [🌐](https://github.com/johnezang/pithy)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: see `lzo` above. LZ4 either overtakes this one or is on par (anno 2022 AD) and I don't see a lot happening here, so the coolness factor is slowly fading...

- ~~**spdlog** [🌐](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: we've decided on using `glog` as the logging library for everything. `spdlog` has some nice features but in the end it was ease of cross-platform compilation and installed base that won out here...

- ~~**xz-utils** [🌐](https://github.com/xz-mirror/xz)~~
  
  - **removed**; reason: see `lzo2` above. When we want this, we can go through [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/) or other thirdparty pipelines.

- ~~**zlog** [🌐](https://github.com/HardySimpson/zlog)~~
  
  - **removed**; `zlog` has a nice overall design but is too 'Unix-is-the-world' in its coding: in the end it was ease of cross-platform compilation of `glog` that won the day and I'm okay with layering on top of that one to get the zlog category and other channel features, once I really need them.
